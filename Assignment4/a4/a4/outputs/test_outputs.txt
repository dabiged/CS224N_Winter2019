You know that what I do is to write for the kids, and in fact, I'm probably the author for kids, you read in the U.S.
And I always tell people I don't want to look like a scientist.
I can <unk> it as a farmer, or with leather clothes, and no one has been chosen a farmer.
I'm here to talk to you about circles and <unk>
And you know that an epiphany is usually something that fell into some place.
You just have to turn the apple to see it as a <unk>
That's the painting of a circle.
A friend of mine did that -- Richard <unk>
It's the kind of complicated circle of which I'm going to talk to you.
My circle started in the <unk> school in the middle school, in <unk> Ohio where I was the rare class.
When they were just going to bleed every week in the children's bathroom, until a teacher saved my life.
She saved my life to let me go into the bathroom of the teachers.
I did it in secret, too.
For three years.
And I had to go out of the city.
He had a thumb and 85 dollars, and I ended up in San Francisco, California -- found a lover -- and in the 1970s -- I felt the need to start working on organizations fighting against AIDS.
About three or four years ago, in the middle of the night I got a phone call from that <unk> Mrs. <unk> who said, "I need to see you.
I'm <unk> that adults never get to know us.
You could go to Ohio and please bring that man that you know you've found.
And I have to tell you that I have <unk> cancer, and I would like you to stand up with this please."
Well, the next day we were in <unk>
We went to see, we got <unk> and we realized that she needed to be <unk>
We found one place, the <unk> and the <unk> and <unk> of his family, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary, because it was necessary,
It's something we knew how to do.
And as the woman I wanted to <unk> as adult came to <unk> it became a <unk> box and it was put in my hands.
And what happened was that the circle was closed, he had become a circle -- and that epiphany that I talked to you was actually present in itself.
<unk> is that death is part of life.
She saved my life, my partner and I save her.
And you know that that part of life needs everything that the rest of life.
It needs truth and beauty, and I'm very happy that today I talked a lot about this.
It needs -- needs dignity, love and pleasure. And it's our work to provide those things.
Thank you.
As an artist, the connection is very important for me.
Through my work, I'm trying to express that humans are not separated from nature and that everything is interconnected.
I went for the first time to Antarctica about 10 years ago, and there I saw my first <unk>
I was amazed.
My heart can fast, was <unk> trying to understand what was in front of me.
<unk> to me around the water <unk> almost 60 feet -- and I couldn't even think that it was a <unk> about a <unk> about a <unk> of snow year after year.
The <unk> are born when they fall out of the glaciers or they break the ice shelves, out.
Each iceberg has its own individual personality.
They have a different way of interacting with their environment and their experiences.
Some of you refuse to give up to the end, while others can't afford it more and <unk> in a <unk> passion for <unk>
It's easy to think about seeing a <unk> that are isolated apart and alone, as much as we see ourselves as humans.
But the reality is the opposite.
As a <unk> I'm breathing its ancestral atmosphere.
As a iceberg melt releases fresh water in minerals that feeds a lot of forms of life.
I come to photograph these <unk> as if it was about the portraits of my ancestors, so knowing that in these unique moments there are in that way and won't come back to being in that way again.
It's not death when it's <unk> it's not an end, but a continuation of your way through the cycle of life.
Part of the <unk> ice is very <unk> it has a couple thousand years.
And another part of the ice has over 100,000 years.
The last pictures I'd like to show you are from a iceberg that I photographed at <unk> Greenland.
It's very often going to come to witness a <unk> iceberg at all.
Here you go.
You can see the left one little boat.
It's about five meters.
And I'd like you to pay attention to the shape of the iceberg and your <unk> line.
You can see here, it starts to <unk> the boat has moved to the other side and the man is there.
This is a iceberg from average.
<unk> from about 120 feet or 40 feet.
This video is in real time.
And so the iceberg just shows you a different side of his personality.
Thank you.
I want you to imagine two couples in 1979, the same day, exactly at the same time, every single <unk> a baby.
So, two couples each with a baby.
I don't want you to go too much on the details of conception, because if they stop to think about a bias in fact, I'm not going to pay attention to me.
Let's think about it for a moment.
And on this stage I want you to imagine that, in one case, the chromosome and the sperm comes into the chromosome out of the <unk>
And in the other case, the X X <unk> joins the chromosome out of the <unk>
Both of them are both <unk> and it starts life.
We're going to be going to talk about them later.
In my activity in my land, I will perform two roles.
In one of my roles work with the story of anatomy.
I am <unk> by training and what I study in this case is the way people were breaking up the anatomy -- that is, of human bodies and <unk> how they have considered the body <unk> the idea of <unk> what have thought about the body.
The other role that I function in my work is an activist, as a <unk> of patients or, as I say sometimes, what I say is <unk> <unk> of people who are medical patients.
In this case, I've been working with people whose physical features defy social norms.
I've been working, for example, with identical twins two people inside a body.
I've worked with people with <unk> people much lower than the average.
And I've worked with many cases of people with <unk> sex, individuals whose physical <unk> doesn't fit into male and female <unk>
In general, we can <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> many ways.
I'm going to give you some examples of ways of having a sex that is not <unk> in the regular common forms or female forms.
For example, there's the case of the individual based on <unk> <unk> which is the <unk> gene.
And then in life <unk> the testicles produce testosterone.
But because this individual lacks testosterone, the body doesn't react to it.
It's <unk> syndrome.
So, there's high testosterone levels, but no reaction.
As a consequence, the body develops following a course typically female <unk>
When he <unk> the baby looks like a child.
It's a little girl. It's raised as a child.
And often, it's not until puberty, when it's growing and developing the breast -- but it doesn't have the menstrual period, when someone realizes something is going on.
After making tests they realize that instead of having <unk> and <unk> actually has testicles and an Y chromosome.
The important thing to understand is that you can think this is a man, but it's actually not like that.
Women, like men, we have in the body -- something called glands <unk>
They're in the back of the body.
<unk> glands produce <unk> the hormone hormone.
Most women like me -- I consider a <unk> woman who is not known to know its structure.
<unk> <unk> and respond to the <unk>
As a result, someone like me has the most exposed to the <unk> that the woman who was born with testicles who has <unk> syndrome.
So sex is complicated -- it's not that the <unk> are in the middle of the <unk> in some form you can be everywhere.
Another example: a few years ago, I got a call from a 19 year-old boy born and raised like <unk> he had girlfriend, and sexual relationships with her, he was wearing a life like a boy and I had just discovered that he had <unk> and <unk>
He had an extreme way of a disease known as <unk> <unk> <unk>
I had blue chromosomes and in the uterus <unk> <unk> they were so active that essentially created a male hormone environment.
As a consequence, the genitals were <unk> his brain was exposed to the hormone component typically male.
He was born with <unk> no one -- no one and <unk>
And it was at the age of 19, when he started having medical problems caused by the internal <unk> when doctors figured out that, in fact, it was woman inside.
Well, another example of a case of <unk>
Some people with 20th chromosomes develop what is known as <unk> -- they have <unk> tissue involved in <unk> tissue.
We don't know exactly why that.
So, there are many varieties of sex.
The reason that children with this kind of bodies are going to be <unk> twins or <unk> or <unk> <unk> surgery -- it's not to be able to make it from a better physical health.
In many cases people are perfectly healthy.
The reason why you get to several surgeries is that they are a threat to our social categories.
The system is based on the idea that a particular anatomy is bringing together a particular identity.
We have the idea that being woman is to have a <unk> identity <unk> being black means having African anatomy in historical terms.
A terribly simplistic idea.
And when you present a body that shows something quite different, we have problems with <unk>
So we have very <unk> ideas in our culture about <unk>
Our nation is based on a very romantic concept of <unk> very romantic.
Imagine how surprising it is to have children born like two people within a body.
The highest case is last year with the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> put on the trial of trial his sex on the <unk> <unk>
A lot of journalists called to wonder: "What test are you going to do to determine whether or <unk> is man or <unk>
And I had to tell the journalists that there is no such idea of it.
In fact, now we know that sex is so complicated that we have to admit that nature doesn't trace a <unk> line between men and women or between men and <unk> and women and <unk> are we who draw that line.
So what we have is a situation where the more the science, the more we need to admit that these <unk> categories were thought were <unk> categories that were <unk> directly with categories of <unk> <unk> they are much more <unk> than <unk>
And not just in terms of sex.
It's also in terms of race, something that happens much more complicated than the terminology <unk>
As we see, we go into a <unk> terrain.
<unk> for example, the fact that we share at least 95 percent of the DNA with chimpanzees.
What do you <unk> from the fact of the <unk> of them in just a few <unk>
And as we moved in science and more and more in a uncomfortable zone where we have to recognize that the <unk> categories that are probably too <unk>
And we're looking at this in all walks of human life.
One of them, for example, in our current culture in the United States today, are the struggles at first and in the end of life.
It's hard to set up a moment from which a body becomes human and has different rights to the <unk>
There are very <unk> discussions today -- not in public, but I know within the <unk> about when someone is considered dead.
Our ancestors never had to do it with this question of whether someone was dead.
As a lot of you put a pen in front of the nose and if he was still not <unk>
If he stopped moving the <unk>
But today, we can, for example, extract vital organs from a body and put them in another body.
And as a result, we need to deal with a really determining dilemma of someone -- and this puts us in a difficult situation where we don't have the simple categories of the past.
And you might think that this explosion of categories could be celebrating somebody like me.
In politics I'm progressive, I'm challenging people with unusual bodies, but I have to admit that it makes me nervous.
And so that these categories are much more fragile than we were thinking about.
<unk> from the point of view of democracy.
And to tell you about this tension first, I have to admit that I'm a fervent <unk> of <unk>
I know they were <unk> I know they were <unk> but they were great.
I mean, they were so brave and bold and so <unk> in what they did, that I find each other and watching that musical <unk> <unk> and not for music, which is totally <unk>
That's what happened in <unk> with the <unk> <unk>
The <unk> <unk> were, to me, the first activists in the anatomy and explain to you why.
What they <unk> was a concept of <unk> and they would compare it to another which was radical and beautiful and stayed for 200 years.
And, as you all remember, what we <unk> our <unk> <unk> was the idea of the <unk> <unk> was based on a very simplistic concept of anatomy.
The old world monarchs didn't know DNA, but they had clear the idea of birth.
They had the concept of blue blood.
They were from the idea that the political power was going to be able to be able to get to political power by the father and the father and then the son, and so on.
The <unk> <unk> rejected that idea and replaced it by a new concept, and that concept was that all men are created equal.
They went into the game field, and they decided that the anatomy that mattered was the common anatomy and not <unk> differences that was very radical.
And in part they were doing it because they were part of a <unk> system, where two things were <unk>
It was <unk> democracy and at the same time -- the science.
And it is very clear, if you look at the history of <unk> <unk> that many were very interested in science and the idea of a <unk> world.
They were <unk> of the explanations -- and so they were <unk> the concept of <unk> being passed by a vague idea of birth.
They were moving towards a <unk> concept.
And if you look -- for example, the Declaration of Independence are talking about nature and the god of nature.
They don't talk about God and the nature of God.
They talk about the power of nature to tell us who we are.
And in a consequence they were passing us the idea of <unk> <unk>
And by doing so, they were laid out the foundations of the future <unk> movement.
They didn't think about it, but they did it for us and it was great.
And what happened next?
And the women <unk>
Then the success of the Civil Rights movement with people from <unk> <unk> who said, "I'm not a <unk>
We found men in the lines of Civil Rights movement saying, "I'm a man."
Again, people of color that are <unk> to <unk> coincidence about the difference -- and again, <unk>
We see the same thing with the <unk> movement.
The problem is, of course, as we look at the <unk> we have to start asking why we keep certain <unk>
But attention, I want to keep some <unk> <unk> in our culture.
For example: I don't want to give a fish for the same rights to a human.
I don't want to say that we should get to anatomy.
I don't want to say that at five years they should allow five years to have sex or get married.
There are some <unk> <unk> which for me makes sense and I think we should be <unk>
But the challenge is to try to figure out what they are, why do they keep them and if they make sense.
Well, let's go back to those two <unk> at the beginning of this talk.
We have two <unk> both <unk> in the middle of 1979 exactly the same day.
Imagine that one of them, Mary, Mary. three months before time: June 1, 1980.
Henry, on the other hand, was born in term: a March June 1, 1980.
For the only fact that I was born three months before Mary are attributed to all the rights three months before Henry -- the right to sexual consent, the right to <unk> the right to <unk>
Henry has to wait for all that not because it has a different biological age, but because he was born later.
We find other <unk> in relation to their rights.
Henry, in virtue of being considered a man -- if I haven't told you if it was <unk> in virtue of being considered to be considered to be a <unk> <unk> that Mary doesn't have to worry about.
Mary, they don't have the same rights to marriage that Henry in all states, for example.
Henry can marry every states with a woman, but Mary can marry a woman only in some states.
So we still have <unk> categories that in a number of aspects are <unk> and questionable.
And now the question is, what do we do now that science is advanced in the field of the anatomy that we get to the point of having to admit that a democracy based on the anatomy could be <unk>
I don't want to give up the science, but at the same time sometimes I feel like science is <unk>
Where are we <unk>
It looks like what happens in our culture is a kind of <unk> attitude -- "Well, we have to draw the line somewhere, so we're going to do."
But a lot of people get caught in a strange position.
For example, Texas at a certain time has decided to marry a man with no man -- and that to marry a woman has to have <unk>
Now, in practice they don't have tested tests on people.
But this is also very strange for the story that I told you at the beginning of <unk> syndrome.
If you look at one of the founding fathers of modern democracy, Dr. Martin Luther King, in his <unk> "I <unk> <unk> offers a solution.
It says that we should judge people judge not in the color of their skin, but in the content of their <unk> going beyond anatomy.
And I want to say, "Yes, the idea looks like this.
But in practice, how do you do?
How do we judge people on the basis of their <unk>
I mean, I also want to point out that I'm not sure that I'm not sure we need to be in this to provide rights to people, because I have to admit that I know some <unk> <unk> that probably deserve more social services than some humans I know.
I also want to say that maybe some <unk> I know you can make more intelligent and smart decisions about their sexual relationships that people in 40 I know.
So how do you put the subject of <unk> content.
It's very hard.
And a part of me asks what would happen if the character of a person could in the future being measured by an instrument, maybe with an MRI.
We really want to get at that point?
I'm not sure where we go.
What I know is that it seems to be very important that the United States will continue to drive this current amount of thinking about democracy.
We've done a good job in defense of democracy and I think we're going to do a good job in the future.
We don't live, for example, in a context like the Iranian that a man who feels attracted to other men is susceptible to being <unk> unless it's willing to have a change in sex, in which case you can live in.
We're not in that situation.
I'm happy to say that we don't have a context like the one of a surgeon that I talked about a couple of years ago that had made light twins <unk> and then pick it up and <unk> his fame.
But when the phone was asked the operation to the operation, he was a very <unk> operation, she said that in that other country these kids would be very <unk> and therefore I had to do it.
So I said, "Well, it's considered the political asylum rather than separation to <unk>
The United States offers huge possibilities to people to be who they are not <unk> to change the very well of the state.
So I think we have to be in your head.
Well, to conclude, I mean I've been talking about the <unk>
And I want to think about what democracy, or as it might have been, if we had given a greater participation to the <unk>
And I want to say something a little bit radical for a feminist, and that is that I think there may be different ideas from different <unk> <unk> in particular if there are people thinking about group.
For years ago, since I've been interested in <unk> I've also been interested in researching the sexual difference.
And one of the things that has been interested in are the differences between men and women in terms of how to think and operate in the world.
And what we know about <unk> studies is that women, on average, -- not all, but in <unk> they tend to pay more attention to complex social relationships and care about those who are <unk> within the group.
And if we think about that, we have an interesting situation in our hands.
And years ago, when I was in graduate school, one of my advisers who knew I was interested in feminism <unk> I thought <unk> as a <unk> made me a <unk>
<unk> what about female <unk>
And I thought, "It's the stupidest question I've heard.
Feminism has to do with unpicking the <unk> <unk> so there is nothing female in the <unk>
But the more I think about your question, the more it has been like to me that there is something feminine in the <unk>
I mean, there might be something, on average, something different between the female brain and the male that makes us more susceptible to complex social relationships and willing to help the most vulnerable.
So if the <unk> were very aware of the way to find the way to protect people over the state, it is possible that we had more <unk> to this concept, maybe we would have enriched the concept of protecting the <unk>
And maybe that's what we need to do in the future when we raise democracy beyond <unk> thinking less in the individual body in terms of identity, and think more about relationships.
So as we try to create a more perfect, let's think about what we do about each other.
Thank you.
In 2007, I decided that we had to reconsider how we think about economic development.
Our new goal should be that when each family thinks where they want to go to live and work, have the ability to choose between at least a handful of different cities that are competing for attracting new residents.
Well, right now, we're far from that goal.
There are billions of people in developing countries that don't have a single city willing to <unk>
But the amazing thing about cities is that they are worth much more than their building cost.
So we could easily <unk> the world -- maybe hundreds of new cities.
Well, this may sound absurd if you have never thought about new cities.
But they just got out of the apartments.
Imagine that half of those who would want to live in apartments are already owners, and that the other half is still failing to do this.
You could try to increase the ability to increase in all existing buildings.
But you know that the problem that we <unk> is that those buildings and areas around them have rules to avoid the <unk> and the distractions of the construction.
So it would be very difficult to do all of those <unk>
But they could go to a totally new place, building a whole new building, and when the rules of that place <unk> the construction instead of putting them <unk>
So I proposed that governments would have new reform zones to contain large cities and gave them a name, cities under <unk>
I later learned that more or less at the same time, <unk> and <unk> were thinking about the challenge of Honduras.
They knew that every year about 75,000 people would come to the United States, and they wanted to ask what they could do to make sure that those people could stay and do those same things in Honduras.
In the summer of 2009 <unk> happened by a constitutional crisis.
In the next regular regular elections <unk> <unk> gave us a platform in which promise reforms and at the same reconciliation.
He asked <unk> who was his head of <unk>
Meanwhile, I was preparing to give a talk at TEDGlobal.
Through a process of <unk> trial and error and a lot of tests with users, I tried to reduce this complicated concept of cities under <unk> to their most essential.
The first point was the importance of norms, like those rules that they say you can't go and send to all the current residents of apartments.
<unk> a lot of attention to new technologies, but it takes both of technologies as well as <unk> rules and usually they are the rules that keep us moving forward.
In the fall of 2010, a friend of Guatemala sent him a link to a TEDTalk.
I showed it to <unk>
They called me up.
They said, <unk> this to the leaders of our <unk>
So in December we met in Miami, in Miami, in a conference room.
I tried to explain to you about this point about how valuable the cities are much more valuable than their cost.
And I used this image that shows the value of the land in a place like New York City.
But it was a pretty abstract discussion and at some point, when there was a pause, <unk> he said, <unk> maybe we could see the video of the <unk> talk.
And the talk described in very simple terms, which a city under <unk> is a place where it starts with <unk> <unk> a <unk> that <unk> the rules that were <unk> there and an option so that people can choose whether they want to go or not live under those norms.
So the president of <unk> called me and said that we had to do this project, this could be important, this could be the way that our country is going forward.
He asked me to be <unk> and I would talk about the four and five from January.
So I presented another talk full of data, which included an image like this, which was trying to explain that to make a lot of value to a city, this has to be very big.
This is a picture of <unk> and the white line is the new airport that was built in <unk>
Only this airport is covers over 100 square miles.
So I was trying to convince the <unk> that to build a new city, you have to start with a site that will be done by at least 1,000 square miles.
That's over 100,000 acres.
Everyone <unk> <unk>
The public faces were very serious and <unk>
The Congress came up to the platform and said, <unk> <unk> thank you very much for your talk, but maybe we could see the video of the TEDTalk.
I have here in my <unk>
So I sat down and showed the TEDTalk.
And this explained to him that a new city can offer new choices for people.
There would be an option of a city that might be going to be in <unk> instead of hundreds of miles away to the North.
And also <unk> new options for leaders.
Because the U.S. government leaders would need help from the countries that are associated with <unk> countries could benefit from the countries associated with setting up and to fulfill the rules of <unk> so that they could all trust the <unk> in fact, <unk>
We went and we saw a site.
This picture is there.
It could easily be a thousand square miles.
And a little bit later, the 19 of January, they voted in Congress to look at their Constitution and add a constitutional available to create these special regions of development.
In a country that I had just passed through this crisis <unk> the voting in favor of this constitutional man was <unk> to one.
All the <unk> all the <unk> in society, the <unk>
For <unk> on the Constitution -- you have to pass twice in Congress.
On February 17, he passed another time into another voting on one another.
Immediately after the voting voting on October 24 to 24 in February, a <unk> <unk> went to the two places in the world that are most interested in engaging in cities.
One of them is South Korea.
This is a picture of a new city center in the city that's building in Korea than the heart of Boston.
Everything you see there was built in four years after they spent four years getting the <unk>
The other country in building cities is Singapore.
In fact, they've already built two cities in China and they're preparing for a third.
And if you think about this, this is the point where we are.
They have a website, and they're already thinking about a place for the second city.
They're preparing a legal system that would allow the administrators to be able to operate under an external legal system.
A country has already committed to allow their Supreme Court to be the ultimate court for this new <unk> system.
There are urban <unk> of cities that are very interested in the project.
They can even get some funding.
But the only thing we know you've already solved is that they have a good number of people.
There are many companies that would like to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to go in a place with a free trade zone, and there are a lot of people who would like to go to live there.
In the world there are 700 million people who say they would like to change immediately to another place.
There's a million a year on Latin America to go to the United States.
Many of them are parents who have to leave back to their family to go and get a work -- sometimes they are mothers who have to earn the money for just eating or buy clothes.
Sadly, sometimes there are even kids who are trying to gather with their parents that haven't seen in some cases, in a decade.
So what does it look like to think about building a new city in <unk>
Or build a dozen of these, or a hundred of these around the world?
What does it seem to think about insisting that families can choose between various cities that are competing for attracting new <unk>
This is an idea worth spreading.
And my friends <unk> I was asked to say, "Thank you a <unk>
I'm a <unk> and this is my <unk>
But before I show you what there is inside, I'm going to make a <unk> <unk> and I live obsessed with the <unk>
I love to find, increasingly, and more recently, to photograph and publish my blog suits and colorful and different for every time.
But I don't buy anything new.
All my clothes is from second hand of <unk> markets.
Ah, thank you.
The second hand stores allow me to reduce the impact of my <unk> in the environment and my <unk>
I go to know people who are doing my money on a good <unk> My way is <unk> and buy it becomes my personal search for <unk>
I mean, what am I going to find today?
I will be from my <unk>
I would like the color <unk>
It will cost less than 20 dollars?
If all of the answers are positive, then I feel that I've won.
To go back to the subject of my <unk> I want to tell you what I would do for this exciting week at TED.
I mean, what does it bring to someone who has all that <unk>
So I'm going to show you exactly what I do.
I brought seven pairs of clothes, and nothing else.
And inside for exactly a week is all I've put in my <unk>
I thought it would be able to find everything else that I'd like to use after getting to Palm <unk>
And because they don't know me as the woman walking at TED in <unk>   That means I found some things.
And I'd like to show you now the sets for this week.
It doesn't sound interesting?
As I do, I'm also going to tell you some of the lessons of life that, believe it or not, I've learned in this journey of not new clothing.
Let's start with Sunday.
This is what I call a brilliant tiger.
You don't have to spend a lot of money to look good.
You can almost always see you, for less than 50 dollars.
All together, including the <unk> made me <unk> and it's the most expensive I've used in the week.
<unk> is energy <unk>
It's almost impossible to be impossible to be <unk> when you're wearing a bright red <unk>
If you're happy, you're going to attract other people happy.
<unk> The integration is <unk>
I've spent a lot of time in life trying to be myself and at the same time.
I just do.
If you get away from the right people, not just <unk> you will be <unk>
<unk> <unk> of the child that you carry in.
Sometimes people tell me that it looks like I play the <unk> or I remember their <unk>
I like to <unk> and say, <unk>
<unk> trust is the key.
If you think you're good at something, it's almost sure you are.
And if you think you don't look good at something, it's probably true.
My mother taught me this day after day.
But it wasn't until the 30 years I really understood his meaning.
And I'm going to explain it in a few seconds.
If you think you are a beautiful person in your inner and outside of it, you don't see you <unk>
So there's no excuse for anybody from this audience.
We need to be able to achieve everything we want to do.
Thank you.
<unk> A universal truth for you: The gold <unk> <unk>
And finally, <unk> <unk> a personal and unique style is a great way to tell the world something about you without having to say a word.
I've tried it again and again when people came up to me this week just by what I was using, and we had fantastic conversations.
Obviously this is not going to go into my little <unk>
So before I went home to Brooklyn, I'm going to donate everything.
Because the lesson I'm trying to learn this week is that we have to leave certain things.
I don't need to <unk> myself to these things, because back in the corner, there will always be another <unk> colorful suit, bright <unk> if there's a little love in my heart and after.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
This is a representation of your brain that we can divide into two parts.
The left side, which is the logic, and the right side, which is the intuitive part.
So if you put a scale to measure the <unk> of each <unk> we could design a blueprint of our brain.
For example, this would be someone who's completely logical.
This would be somebody who's totally intuitive.
So, where are your brain on this scale?
Some <unk> by one of these ends, but I think that for most of the members of this audience, their brain is something like -- with a big <unk> in both of them at the same time.
It's not that they're mutually <unk>
You can be logical and intuitive.
I consider one of those people, just like most other quantum physicists, <unk> we need a lot of logic to create these complicated ideas.
But at the same time, we need a lot of intuition to make the experiments really work.
How do we develop this <unk> Well, we like to play with things.
We put them to play with them and then we see how they react. And then we develop our intuition from that point.
And actually, you do the same thing.
<unk> intuition that you may have developed over the years is the one that says that one thing can be only in one place at once.
I mean, it might sound weird to think that one thing is in two different places at the same time, but you weren't born with this <unk> the <unk>
I remember looking at a child playing on a parking bar.
It was a little boy and I didn't do it very well, it always was <unk>
But I bet the playing with that parking lot, he taught him a valuable lesson, and that is that the big things don't allow the <unk> and they stay in a place.
This is a very conceptual model that you can have from the world, except you will be a particle physicist.
It would be a terrible model for a particle physicist, because they don't play with <unk> <unk> they play with these strange particles.
And when they play with their particles, they discover that they do all kinds of really weird things -- like they can go through walls, or they can be in two different places at the same time.
And then they wrote all these observations, and they called the theory of quantum mechanics.
At that point it was the physics of a few years, you needed of quantum mechanics to describe those little particles.
But you don't need to describe the big objects around us every day.
That didn't fit very well to my intuition, and maybe it's because I don't play very often with particles.
Well, sometimes play with them, but not a lot.
And I've never seen them.
I mean, nobody saw a <unk>
But I didn't fit well to my logic.
Because if everything is made of small particles and all the little particles follow the principles of quantum mechanics, then it shouldn't all follow the principles of quantum <unk>
I don't find the reason why it doesn't should.
And so I would feel much better if I could somehow demonstrate that an ordinary object also follows the principles of quantum mechanics.
That's why a few years ago, I proposed to do exactly that.
And I did.
This is the first object you can see that has been in an overlap of quantum mechanics.
What we see here is a little computer chip.
And you can try to see the green dot right in the middle.
That's the metal piece I'm going to talk about in a minute.
This is a picture of the object.
And here I'm going to zoom in a little bit. It's just at the center.
And then here we do a good deal with the little <unk> of metal.
What we see is a little bit of metal little little bit of metal shape, and which is <unk> on a platform.
And then I did this almost in the same way that a computer chip.
I went to a clean room with a silicon chip, and I started working all the big machines for about 100 hours.
For the last material, I had to build my own machine -- to do this hole with a swimming <unk> that is under the device.
This device has the ability to be in a quantum overlap but it needs a little bit of help.
Let me make an analogy.
You know how awkward it is to be on an elevator full of people.
I mean, when I'm on an elevator alone, I do all kinds of weird things, but then when other people go up up to do those things, because I don't want to get them to them, or actually <unk>
Quantum mechanics says that inanimate objects behave in the same way.
The colleagues of inanimate objects are not just people, it's also the light that <unk> it and the wind that goes on on the side and the heat of the room.
So we knew that if we wanted this little piece of metal to behave according to quantum mechanics, we would have to <unk> all the other passengers.
And that's what we did.
We introduced the lights, then we introduced a <unk> and pulled it out of the air -- and then you put it down to a temperature of less than a degree above absolute zero.
Now, when being only in the <unk> the little metal piece of metal is free to act like it.
So we measure their movements.
We found that it moved in very strange ways.
Instead of staying perfectly still, it was vibrating. And the way it <unk> was like a breath in this way -- like a <unk> that expands and <unk>
And by giving it a smooth body, we were able to make it <unk> and that didn't go at the same time -- something that only happens with quantum mechanics.
So what I'm telling you is something really fantastic.
What does it mean that a <unk> thing is not going to do the same time?
Let's think about atoms.
In one case, all the trillion atoms that make up that piece of metal that make that piece of metal are still and at the same time, those same atoms are moving up and down.
It's just in certain <unk> when those are <unk>
In the rest of the time they're <unk>
It means that each atom is in two different places at the same time, which means that the whole piece of metal is in two different places.
I think this is great.
Seriously.
It was worth <unk> in a clean room to do this for all those years, because, look at this, the difference on a scale between one single atom and that little metal piece is kind of the same as the difference between that little metal piece of metal and you.
So if one single atom can be in two different places at the same time, and that piece of metal can be in two different places, why don't you possibly too?
I mean, it's my logical part of speech.
So imagine if you were in several places at the same time, how would that be that?
How do you act your consciousness if your body is <unk> in space?
There's another part of the story.
And it's when we put it, and we turned the lights and look inside the box, we saw that the metal was still there in a single piece.
And I could get to this new intuition, apparently all the objects on the elevator are actually only quantum objects that are just <unk> in a small space.
You hear a lot about that quantum mechanics claims that everything is interconnected.
Well, that's not so true.
It's more than that, it's deeper.
It's that those connections, your connections to all the things that are around you, literally define who you are, and that's the deep queerness of quantum mechanics.
Thank you.
My name is <unk>
And 18 months ago, I was doing another job at Google, until I launched the idea of doing something related to museums and art to my head who's here and that allowed me to do it.
It took me 18 months and 18 of me.
Many negotiations and stories will be done with 17 very interesting museums of nine countries.
But I'm going to focus on the <unk>
There's a lot of stories of why we did it.
I think my own story is explaining just on this slide and this is access.
I grew up in India.
I had a great education -- I didn't get <unk> but I didn't have access to many of these museums and artwork.
So when I started traveling and go to museums, I started learning a lot.
And working on Google, I try to actually make the desire to do it more accessible by technology.
So we formed a team, a great team of people, and we started doing it.
I better show you a demo of the demo then to explain to you a couple of interesting things that we've taken out from his launch.
So, let's go back to <unk>
Look around all the museums that are.
There's the gallery <unk> the <unk> the <unk> the <unk> <unk>
I'm actually going to go into one of my favorites, in the <unk> the art museum in New York.
There are two ways to do it -- very simple.
We click and <unk> we are already inside the museum.
No matter where they are, <unk> or <unk> that doesn't really matter.
You are moving around and <unk>
Do you want to navigate the <unk>
We opened the flat floor, and with one click, we jumped in.
They're inside, that you want to go to the end of the ground.
And go ahead and go forward.
<unk>
Thank you, but I haven't got the best.
Now I'm in front of one of my favorite paintings -- "The <unk> of <unk> <unk> in the <unk>
I see the <unk>
If the museum shows us the image, we click there.
Look, this is one of the images.
Here's all the information <unk>
For those of you who are truly interested in art, you can click there, but I'm going to click here right now.
And this is one of the images we've captured in what we call the <unk> technology.
So this image for example, <unk> I think, about 10,000 million of them.
And there are many people who ask me, "What do you get with 10,000 million <unk>
So I'm going to show you what you really do with 10,000 million people here.
You can zoom in around it very simple.
You see fun things that are happening.
I love this guy, his expression doesn't have the price.
But if you really want to get <unk>
So I started to play, and I found myself with something that was going on there.
And I said, "Wait a moment, this seems to be <unk>
I went into and discovered that kids were actually playing something in playing something.
And I did a little bit, I talked to some people in the <unk> and I actually found that this is a game called <unk> which is on hitting a <unk> with a <unk> <unk>
And apparently it was very popular.
I don't know why they did, but I've learned something about it.
And now we're going to get further deeper than you'll see that you can actually get to the cracks.
Now just to give you a little bit of perspective, I'm going to take the image, so you'll see really what there is.
Here's where we were, and this is the painting.
The best thing is to come, a second.
So now we're going to go over again at MoMA in New York.
Here's another one of my favorites, <unk> <unk>
The example I showed was to find details.
But what if you want to see the <unk>
And if you want to see how Van Gogh actually created this <unk>
It goes up and really <unk>
I'm going to one of my favorite parts in this picture, and I'm actually going to get to the cracks.
This is <unk> night -- I think I had never seen this before.
I'm going to show you one other favorite functions.
There are lots of things more here, but I don't have time from <unk>
This is the really cool part. It's called <unk>
All of you, absolutely everyone, no matter whether it's rich or poor, or if you have a <unk> that gives you the same.
You can online to create your own museum, to create their own collection from all these images.
It's very simple, we walk in -- I've created this function I call "The power of <unk> -- we just did a zooming around.
This is about <unk> at the National Gallery in London.
You can write things, send it to your friends and keep a conversation about what they feel at contemplating these <unk> works.
So in conclusion, I think for me, the main thing is that all amazing things really don't come from Google.
No, in my opinion, they even have come from museums.
Maybe I shouldn't say this.
Actually, they come from those artists.
And that's been my humble experience with this.
I mean, I hope that in this digital medium does justice to its work of art and is represented properly online.
And the big question I do today is: "You do this to repeat the experience of going to a <unk>
And the answer is no.
It's to supplement the experience.
And that's it. Thank you.
Thank you.
Good evening everybody.
I've got something to show you.
Think of it is a <unk> a pixel <unk>
In our lab we call it sensitive design.
Let me tell you a little bit about this.
If you look at this picture -- I am from Italian, all the children in Italy grow with this picture on the wall of his bedroom. But the reason I'm showing you this is that it has happened very interesting in <unk> careers in the last two decades.
So, sometime ago, if you wanted to win a <unk> career, one, take a budget, and you get it to a good pilot and a good car.
And if the car and the pilot were good enough, you made the race.
This is what in engineering, it will become real time control system.
It's essentially a system that has two <unk> a sensor and a <unk>
What's interesting is that systems control systems are starting to get into our lives.
Our cities, over the last few years, have been covered with networks and electronics.
They're becoming <unk>
And as <unk> they're starting to respond differently and can be <unk> and <unk>
<unk> cities is a big thing.
As other note I wanted to say that cities are only two percent of the cortex of the planet but they represent 50 percent of the world's population.
75 percent of the <unk> of <unk> and to 80 percent of the CO2 emissions.
If we could do something with cities, it would be a big thing.
Beyond cities, all these <unk> and <unk> are entering our everyday objects.
This is from an exhibition of <unk> <unk> on the late year at MoMA, during the summer.
It's called <unk> to <unk> <unk>
Well, our objects, the environment, start <unk>
In a way, it's like almost all the existing atoms to become sensors and <unk>
And that's completely changing the interaction that as humans have with the outside environment.
In some sense, it's almost like the old dream of Miguel <unk>
You know, when Michelangelo <unk> the <unk> is said that at the end, he took the hammer away, and he threw it into the Moses -- and you can still see a little <unk> <unk> and said, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Well, today, our environment starts to <unk>
And I'm going to show you just a little bit of <unk> <unk> in the idea of capturing the environment and we use something.
Let's start with the detection.
The first project I wanted to share with you is actually one of the first projects of our lab.
This was four and a half years ago in Italy.
It was a summer for 2006.
It was the year that Italy won the World Cup of the World.
Maybe some of you remember it, they would play Italy and France, and at the end, <unk> gave the <unk>
And anyway, I won Italy.
Now let's look at what happened that day by looking at activity in the network.
Here we see the city.
You see the <unk> in the middle and the <unk> River.
It's the morning, before the game.
The time line is at the top.
At the afternoon, there are people over here and doing <unk>
It starts the <unk> silence.
<unk> from France.
You know, people do a quick call to the toilet.
Second time. End of time.
<unk> <unk> second.
<unk> and at a moment, the <unk>
<unk> Italy, <unk>
That night they all went to the center.
There you see the great peak.
The next day they were all in the center of the winning team and the prime minister then.
And then everybody <unk>
You see the image of the place called <unk> <unk> where, from <unk> people are going to be <unk> it's a great party, you can see the peak at the end of the day.
This is just an example of how you can measure the pulse of the city in a way that we wouldn't have been able to do just a few years ago.
Another quick example of <unk> is not about people, but things we use and we consume.
Today, we know everything about the emergence of our objects.
This is a map that shows all the chips that make up a hint at how they <unk>
But we know very little about where things are.
So in this project, we developed some small tags to track the trash in its shift by the system.
We started with a few volunteers who helped us in Seattle a little bit more than a year ago, to tag what were <unk> different kinds of things, as you can see, things that are all <unk>
Then we put a little chip, one <unk> to the garbage and then we started <unk>
These are the <unk> results.
From <unk>
after a week.
With this information we realized that there are many <unk> in the system.
We can do the same with much less energy.
These are data that didn't exist before.
They're going on complicated things, and there's a lot of <unk>
But the other thing that we think is that if we look at every day that the cup that we are dropping not away, it's still somewhere on the planet.
What if the plastic bottle that we throw out one day is still there.
If we show that to people, then we will be able to promote some change change.
That was the reason for the project.
My colleague at MIT, <unk> <unk> could tell us a lot more about detection and many other cool things that we can do with that, but I wanted to go to the second part that we talked about at first, which is <unk>
And the first project is something we did a couple years ago in <unk>
It all started with a question of the mayor of the city that came and told us that Spain and southern Europe have a beautiful tradition of using water in public space, in architecture.
And the question was, how can technology do technology, the new technology, join that?
And one of the ideas that we developed at MIT, in a workshop was, imagine you have a <unk> and <unk> vacuum tubes that open and <unk>
It creates a curtain of water, with pixels of water.
If the pixels can be written on them, I'll show patterns, images, images, <unk>
And when you zoom in, the curtain will open so that we can happen, as you see in the image.
We introduced this to the Mayor <unk>
I liked it very much.
<unk> a commission to design the entrance to the entrance to <unk>
We call it a <unk> <unk>
The entire building is made of water.
There are no doors no windows, but when you come up with it opens up so you can happen.
The ceiling is also covered with water.
And if there's a bit of wind, if you want to minimize the <unk> it goes down the roof.
Or you can close the building and all the architecture disappears, like this case.
Those days will always be somebody, in the winter, when the roof, someone who was there and said, <unk> the <unk>
No, it's not that you've got it, but when you go down and almost all the architecture goes down.
Here it works.
You see people <unk> so it goes in.
And here I'm myself trying to do not <unk> when the sensors open the water.
I think I should tell you what happened one night when all the sensors stopped working.
That night was actually even more fun.
All the kids in <unk> came to the building, because the way we interact had changed a little bit.
It was no longer a building that would open to let you go, but a building that kept making <unk> and holes in water, and you had to jump in for not <unk>
<unk> <unk> And for us that was really interesting because as architects, engineers, designers, always we think about how people give our designs.
But then the reality is always unpredictable.
And that's the beauty of doing things to interact with, that people use.
This is a picture of the building with the physical pixels and the pixels of water, and of projections on them.
And this is what led us to think about the next project I'm going to show you.
Imagine that those pixels could begin to fly.
Imagine that you could have little helicopter helicopters and each one had a small pixel that changes color as if it was a cloud that moves into space.
This is the video.
Imagine a helicopter, like what we saw before, which is moving with others in synchrony.
We could form this cloud,
It's a kind of flexible screen like this with a normal configuration in two dimensions.
Or normal, but in three dimensions, what it changes is the light, not the position of the smoking.
You can play with a different type of play.
Imagine that the screen appears on different scales and sizes, in different kinds of resolution.
And then all of that could be a cloud of pixels in 3D which you can get close to and see from very different <unk>
This is the real <unk> <unk> going down to form a <unk> like before.
When the light comes on, you see this. The same thing we saw before.
Imagine each one of them controlled by one person.
We can have every pixel with an entry that comes from people, from the movement of people, etc., etc.
I want to show you something for the first time.
We've been working with <unk> <unk> <unk> of the best <unk> dancers of today, the New York City <unk> and the <unk> of <unk> to capture their 3D motions and use them as input for <unk>
Here we can see <unk> dancing.
On the left side, you see the <unk> it captures in different <unk>
It's so much 3D <unk> as a movement capture.
It can <unk> all the movement.
You can walk all the way.
And once we have the pixels we can play with them, with the color and the movement, with gravity and <unk>
We want to use this as an input for <unk>
I wanted to show you the last project we're working on.
It's something for the London Olympics.
It's called the <unk>
And the idea is, imagine again, that we could engage people to do something and change our environment, like an oyster nursery like <unk> <unk> but with a cloud.
Imagine that we could make everybody <unk> a little bit for a <unk>
And I think the remarkable thing that has happened over the last few years is that, in the last two decades, we went from the physical world to the digital world.
We've digitized everything as knowledge, and it's accessible to the Internet.
Today, for the first time -- and the Obama Obama campaign -- we can go from the digital world, of the power of networks, to physical world.
In our case, this may be that we wanted to use it to design and make a <unk>
That would mean something built in a city.
But tomorrow can be to address the challenges of today: think about climate change or CO2 emissions, how to go from the digital world to the physical world.
The idea is that we can make people involved in doing this together, in a collective form.
The cloud is a cloud, again, made out of pixels in the same way that the real cloud is a cloud of particles.
And those particles are water, whereas in our cloud they are smoking.
This is a physical structure in London, but he was covered at the time.
You can move around the inside, you have different experiences.
You can see from the bottom, to serve the main moments of the 2012 Olympics and even more, and it can be used as a way of connection to the community.
So it's both a physical cloud of the sky as something you can go up like a new <unk> of London.
You can get into there.
As if it was a new digital <unk> at night, but the most important thing is to be a new experience for anyone that goes to the top.
Thank you.
Would you like to be better than what they are.
Suppose you would tell you that, with just a few changes in their genes, they could improve <unk> by a more accurate and faster.
Or maybe they would like to be in better ways, to be stronger to have more <unk>
Would you like to be more attractive and <unk>
How about living more <unk>
Or maybe these people who always wanted to be more creative.
What else are you going to tell you.
What would you like to do if you could choose something?
<unk> <unk> <unk>
How many people would choose creativity?
Raise your hands. Let me look at.
<unk> probably got to the number of creative people present.
That's very good.
How many would <unk>
A few more.
And the <unk> state.
A little less.
How about <unk>
Oh, most of you. That makes me feel very well as a doctor.
If you could have some of this the world that would be very different.
It's just <unk>
Or maybe this is possible?
Evolution has been a <unk> theme here at the TED Conference but today I want to give you a physician on the subject.
The great <unk> of the 20th century, <unk> <unk> in addition to the Church of <unk> <unk> wrote a trial called "No biology in biology makes sense of light from <unk>
But if you actually accept biological evolution consider this: it's just the past, or the future?
It's about others or us?
This is another look at the tree of life.
The human part of this branch, well on one end, is, of course, the most interested in us.
<unk> of a common ancestor with modern chimpanzees about six or eight million years ago.
Within 20 or 25 different species of <unk>
Some have gone and <unk>
We've been here about <unk> years.
It might seem to be very far from other parts of this tree of life, but actually, in most of the basic machinery of our cells is roughly the same.
They realize that we can leverage and control the machinery of a common bacteria protein to produce the protein of human insulin that is used to treat <unk>
This is not like insulin insulin -- but it's the same protein, which is a chemically <unk> which is coming out of pancreatic cancer.
And by talking about bacteria -- they realize that we all carry on the gut more bacteria than the cells we have in the rest of the body?
Maybe 10 times more.
I mean, think about that when Antonio <unk> raises the <unk> they think about <unk>
The gut is a beautifully <unk> environment for those bacteria.
It's warm dark, therein is very <unk>
And we're going to provide all the nutrients that they can want no effort to be.
It really is a quick way to the bacteria with the occasional disruption of the occasional <unk>
But by others, we are a wonderful environment for those bacteria in the same way that they are essential to our life.
They help digest nutrients <unk> and they protect us from certain diseases.
But what are we going to care about the future?
We're in a kind of evolutionary balance as a species?
Or meant to become something different, something maybe better adapted to <unk>
In this vast symphony <unk> of the universe, life on Earth is like a brief <unk> the animal kingdom, like one and only <unk> and human life, a little bit of grace.
That was us.
And it was also the <unk> part of this talk, so I hope you've got it.
When I first went to college, I had my first kind of biology.
I was fascinated by the elegance and the beauty of biology.
I fell in love with the power of evolution and I realized something fundamental -- most of the existence of life, in the <unk> organisms, each cell just <unk> and all the genetic energy of that cell is transmitted to two cells.
But when organisms come along, things start to change.
It goes into sexual reproduction.
And something really important -- with the emergence of sexual reproduction that passes the genome, the rest of the body becomes <unk>
In fact, you could say that the <unk> of the body death enters the same time of sexual reproduction.
I have to confess that when I was a college student, I was thinking, well, <unk> death for <unk> seemed pretty reasonable at that time, but with every year that was happening, every time had more <unk>
I got to understand the feelings of George <unk> who still <unk> in Las Vegas in their 90 years.
And one night someone hits his door door to it.
He opens the door.
In front of him you find a magnificent little dancer.
He looks at it and says, <unk> in search of a <unk> <unk>
I said, "Okay, says, "I say, "I chose the <unk>
I realized, as a doctor, who was working for a different target to the goal of <unk> not necessarily <unk> just different.
I was trying to preserve the body.
I wanted us to be healthy.
I wanted to get health in the disease.
I wanted to live more and more in a healthier way.
Evolution is going to pass the genome to the next <unk> <unk> and <unk> generation after generation.
From an evolutionary point of view, you and I are like <unk> rockets designed to send genetic charge to the next level, and then let us fall into the sea.
I think everybody else -- the feeling that expressed Woody Allen when he said, "I don't want to get the immortality through my work.
I want to say <unk> not <unk>
Evolution doesn't necessarily apply to longevity.
They don't necessarily apply to the bigger or the stronger or even the more intelligent and even the more smart.
Evolution favors the very best creatures.
That's the only proof of survival and success.
In the bottom of the ocean -- the <unk> bacteria, that they can survive the heat of the <unk> that <unk> if there were fish there, fish -- <unk> seafood in <unk> yet they've managed to do that a <unk> environment.
So what does this mean when we look at what's happening in evolution and if we go back to thinking about the place of humans in evolution and, in particular, if we look forward to the <unk> phase -- I would say there are many possibilities.
The first one is that I don't know.
We've reached a kind of balance.
And the underlying thinking would be that through medicine, first of all, we've known to preserve a lot of genes that otherwise would have been <unk> and <unk> of the population.
And secondly, as a species, we have <unk> our environment to fit us to us as we adapt to it.
And by the way, <unk> <unk> and <unk> us so much that it is no longer possible to have the necessary isolation that we have to think about evolution.
A second possibility is that you produce a evolution of the traditional traditional type, because of the forces of nature.
And the argument here is: that the gears of evolution roll slowly, but they're <unk>
And as soon as the <unk> as a kind of <unk> planets are going to exist in isolation and environmental changes that can produce natural evolution.
But there is a third possibility, a <unk> intriguing and scary possibility.
I call it the <unk> the new evolution, which is not just <unk> but <unk> and elected by us as individuals in the decisions that are <unk>
Now, how could this happen?
How could we get to do this?
First of us consider the reality that many people today, in some cultures, are making decisions about their offspring.
In some cultures, they're choosing more males than women.
It's not necessarily good for society, but it's what you choose to the individual and familiar.
Think of it also that if it was possible to be able to choose not only sex of their <unk> but in their own body to make genetic adjustments to cure or prevent disease.
And if we could make genetic changes to remove the diabetes or Alzheimer's or reduce the risk of cancer or remove the <unk>
Would you not want to do those changes in your <unk>
If we look at the future that kind of changes will be increasingly possible.
The Human Genome Project began in 1990, and he sued 13 years.
<unk> <unk> million dollars.
The next year of being done, in 2004, I could do the same work for 20 million dollars in three or four months.
Today, you can get a full sequence of the 3,000 billion base pairs in the human genome at a cost to 20,000 dollars and on a week.
Not too much for you to make the human genome for <unk> and being more and more at the reach of all.
These are the changes.
The same technology that has produced quantum insulin in bacteria can make viruses that are not only going to protect themselves but they're going to induce <unk> against other viruses.
<unk> or there's no experimental trial in the course of the flu vaccine growing up in cells from <unk>
Can you imagine something good that comes out of the <unk>
That's actually today and the future is going to be more and more possible.
Imagine just two other two little <unk>
You can change the cells from their bodies but if they could change the cells of their <unk>
And if you could change sperm and <unk> or changing the egg of the <unk> and give their children a better chance of a healthy life, remove the diabetes, remove the <unk> reduce the risk of cancer?
Who doesn't want children more <unk>
And then, that same technology <unk> that same engine of science that can produce the changes to prevent diseases will also allow us to use <unk> <unk> a better memory.
Why don't you have the ingenuity of a Ken <unk> especially if you could do it with the next generation of the machine <unk>
Why don't you have a <unk> muscle that allows us to run faster and more <unk>
Why don't you live longer?
This is going to be convinced here.
And when we are in conditions to pass this to the next generation and we can adopt the attributes that we wanted to have turned before in the <unk>
We're going to take a process that normally could take 100,000 years and we can take it to 1,000 years and maybe happen within the next 100 years.
These are choices that their grandchildren, or the grandchildren of their grandchildren, are going to have them.
We're going to use these choices to make a better better, more successful society.
Or, let's choose to selectively selectively attributes that we want for some of us but not for others?
We're going to build a society that is more boring and more robust or more robust and more <unk>
This is the kind of question we're going to have to face.
And the deeper of all, we're going to be able to develop the wisdom and inherit the wisdom necessary to make these <unk> decisions.
For good or for worse, and before what you could do, these options are going to depend on us.
Thank you.
Imagine a big explosion when you're at 900 feet tall away.
Imagine a plane filled with smoke.
Imagine a motor making <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Well, I had a unique seat that day. He was sitting in the <unk>
It was the only one that I could talk to the <unk> <unk>
So I immediately looked at them, and they said, "No problem. You probably <unk> some <unk>
And the pilot had <unk> the plane, and we weren't so far.
You could see Manhattan.
Two minutes later, three things happened at the same time.
The pilot pilot the plane with the Hudson River.
Mostly that's not the road.
And the engines.
Imagine being on a plane and not <unk>
And then he said three words.
three more <unk> words than ever heard.
He said, <unk> for the <unk>
I didn't have to talk more to the flight.
I was able to see it in his eyes.
It was terror. Life was <unk>
I want to share with you three things I learned about myself.
I learned that everything changes in a moment.
We have this list of things to do before I die, these things that we want to do in life, and I thought about all the people I wanted to get in, and I didn't do it, all the fences that I wanted to repair all the experiences that I have wanted to have and never come back.
As I was thinking more ahead, I came up with a sentence, which is, <unk> wine <unk>
Because if the wine is ready and the person is there, I'll set it up.
I don't want to show you anything in life.
And that urgency, that purpose, really has changed my life.
The second thing I learned that day -- and this is the time you <unk> the George Washington, which wasn't for a lot of -- I thought about, <unk> I really feel a big <unk>
I've lived a good life.
In my humanity and my mistakes, I've tried to improve everything I did.
But in my humanity, I also give rise to my ego.
And I'm sorry for the time that I think about things that didn't care about people who do matter.
And I thought of my relationship with my wife, with my friends, with people.
And then, as <unk> in that, I decided to remove the negative energy from my life.
It's not perfect, but it's much better.
In two years, I haven't had a fight with my wife.
It feels like <unk>
I'm no longer trying to have <unk> <unk> being <unk>
The third thing I learned -- and this is how your mental watch is <unk> <unk> 14, <unk>
You see the water <unk>
I'm saying, "Please get <unk>
I don't want this to be broken in 20 pieces as you see in those <unk>
And as I <unk> I had a sense of, "I will die doesn't fear.
It's almost like we've been <unk> for our entire life.
But it was very sad.
I didn't want to myself, I love my life.
And that sadness is <unk> in a single thought, which is, just wish one thing.
I wish I could see my kids grow.
One month later, I was in a performance of my daughter -- first grade, not much artistic talent --  -- and I scream, <unk> as a little boy.
And for me, that was all the reason for the world.
At that point, I understood those two points, which the only thing that matters in my life is to be a great father.
For all, the only goal I have in life is to be a good father.
He gave me a miracle, not to die that day.
And it gave me another gift, which was the possibility to look at the future and come back and live in another way.
You guys are flying today, the challenge to imagine that the same thing happens to you in your plane -- and please not be like that, but you can imagine, and how do you get it?
What is it that they are going to do because they think they're going to live <unk>
How does your relationships change the negative energy in them?
And most importantly, they're the best parents to <unk>
Thank you.
I've clearly been blessed in life with many projects.
But the most cool thing I worked was for this guy.
The guy is called <unk>
<unk> was one of the most important <unk> in the '80s.
A day came to his house after running and said, "Dad, I feel a <unk> <unk>
And that was the beginning of ALS.
Today, it has complete paralysis today.
You can only use your eyes.
His work influenced me.
I have a design company and animation so that, obviously, the graffiti is something <unk> that we admire and <unk> in the world of art.
So we decided we were going to get them to <unk> <unk> and their cause.
So I went and met with his brother and her father and I said, "We're going to give you this money.
What are they going to do with <unk>
And his brother said, "I just want to be able to talk to Tony again.
I just want to be able to communicate with him and that he's able to communicate with me."
And I said, "A second is not that you can see Stephen <unk> -- not that all people with paralysis can communicate by those <unk>
And he said, "No, unless you're going to be somebody important and you can't actually do it.
These devices are not accessible to people."
And I said, "Well, how do you communicate then?"
Did anybody see the movie <unk> <unk> and <unk>
They communicate that way, they're going to make the <unk>
I said, "That's <unk> How can it be?"
And so I presented to the only desire to deliver a check and instead of that sign a check that I didn't have the least idea of how I was going to get to <unk>
I got married with his brother and his father there at that very moment, "OK, this is the <unk> Tony is going to speak, and we're going to build a machine, and we're going to find a way to make your art again.
Because it's ridiculous that somebody who has so much on your inside can't be <unk>
So I talked about a conference a couple of months later.
I met these guys called <unk> <unk> Research -- that have a technology that allows them to project a light on any surface and then with a laser pointer -- they draw over that and register the negative space.
So they go around making art facilities like this.
All the things that <unk> they say, they're part of a life cycle.
First you start with sexual organs, then with the bad words, then with the Bush attacks, and in the end, people start making art.
But there was always a life cycle in their <unk>
And so the journey started.
And about two years later, about a year later, after a lot of organization and so much moving things from one side we had a couple of things.
One, you touch the doors of insurance companies, and we got a machine to make it <unk> a machine like Stephen <unk>
Which was great.
And seriously, it's the most <unk> I call it <unk> because when I talk to the guy you get an email from him, and you say, "I don't know. This guy's <unk>
The other thing we did was bring seven programmers all over the world <unk> all the corner of the <unk> to our house.
My wife, the kids and I, we moved to the garage and these hackers and programmers and <unk> they took control of the house.
Many of our friends thought we were doing something completely stupid and that when they were born, they would have taken off the frames of the walls and in their place there would be <unk>
But for two weeks, we were going to go to the shipping <unk> <unk> my son was part of my dog too, and we created this.
It's called <unk> <unk> and you can see the <unk>
It's a couple of cheap <unk> glasses that we buy in the shipping <unk> Beach, some copper wire.
We take a camera <unk> the <unk> we put it on an LED light, and now there's a device that is free -- and we publish the <unk> we published the software -- the software goes down by free.
And we create a device that has no limitation at all.
There is no insurance company to say.
There is no hospital that I can say.
Anyone with paralysis today has access to draw and communicate using only his eyes.
Thank you.
Thank you very much for you.
So at the end of the two weeks we went back to the <unk> room.
I love this picture because this is the room of another person, and that's his room.
There was all this <unk> and <unk> during the great opening.
And after more than a year of planning, two weeks of programming intense sessions from all night, Tony <unk> to draw for the first time in seven years.
And this is a wonderful picture because this is the support system of his life and it's looking through the support system of their life.
We ran the bed so that I could see.
And we put a projector on a wall of the parking lot in the hospital.
And he came back for the first time in front of his family and friends and you can imagine what was the feeling in the parking lot.
The funny thing was that we had to bust in the parking lot, so we felt like we were <unk> the graffiti as well.
At the end of this, he sent us an email and this was what he said, "This was the first time he drew in seven years.
I felt as if I had been under the water and someone finally came to me and get me out there so that I could do it.
It's not <unk>
In a way, that's our scream for war.
That's what keeps us in motion, and developing.
And we have a long way to go through this.
It's a cool device, but it's the equivalent of a <unk> <unk>
Someone with this artistic potential it deserves much more.
So we're trying to figure out how to <unk> and make it faster and robust.
Since then, we've had all kinds of recognition.
We've gained a lot of awards.
Remember, it's <unk> none of us are making money with this.
Everything comes out of our own pockets.
The prizes were the <unk> "Oh, this is <unk>
Armstrong <unk> something about us and then, in December, Time magazine recognized us as one of the 50 best inventions in 2010, and it was really cool.
The best thing about this -- and this is what ends up about closing the <unk> is that in April of this year in the <unk> of <unk> in the center of Los Angeles is going to be an exhibition called <unk> in the <unk>
And <unk> in the <unk> it's going to have the best <unk> of urban art <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> they're all going to be there.
<unk> is going to be on the show which is pretty impressive.
So, basically this is my idea: if you look at something that's not possible, do it possible.
Nothing that there is in this room was possible -- the computer, the computer, the microphone, the <unk> nothing was possible at some point.
Do it <unk> anything in this room.
I'm not a programmer, I never did anything with <unk> recognition technology, I just recognized something and <unk> with wonderful people to make it happen.
And these are the questions I want all of us to do every day when we find something that we feel like to do, if it's not now, if I'm not now, <unk> And if I'm not me, who?
Thank you guys.
I've spent the last few years <unk> in situations generally very hard and at the same time as dangerous time.
I went to the tough <unk>
I worked in a dangerous <unk>
It would be in areas of <unk> difficult and dangerous.
And I spent 30 days to eat just this -- fun at first, something difficult in the middle, very dangerous at the end.
In fact, in a lot of my career, I have been <unk> in particular <unk> situations with the only goal of trying to examine social questions in ways that are <unk> attractive, interesting, and hopefully analyzing them in a way that they see fun and accessible to the audience.
So when I learned that I would come here to do a TEDTalk on the world of brands and <unk> I wanted to do something a little bit different.
So some of you may have heard of, or not, a couple of weeks ago, I pulled out a <unk>
A few messages on Facebook, some on Twitter, I offered the rights of the name of my TEDTalk in 2011.
What I had was this: <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> my TEDTalk that you have no idea what it is about and according to content in the face, especially if I put it in a ridiculous to you or your company to do it.
But I said, this is a very good opportunity to do that.
Do you know how many people look at these <unk>
<unk>
It's a degree in progress, by the way.
So even with that <unk> I knew someone was going to buy the rights for the name.
If you had asked me a year ago, I would never have been able to do it with certainty.
But in the new film that I'm working, we tested the world of marketing <unk>
And as I said before, I've been involved in horrible situations in the last few years, but nothing could be done -- nothing could be done for something as difficult or as dangerous as entering the rooms with these guys.
You see, I had this idea for a movie.
Morgan <unk> I want to make a film that tries to be about the <unk> of products, marketing and advertising, and that all film is <unk> with products, marketing and advertising.
The movie is going to be called "The largest movie ever <unk>
What happens in "The largest movie ever <unk> is that everything up at the bottom, at the end, it has a brand imagery of brand, all the time -- from the <unk> that appears before the title of the title, <unk> brand <unk>
Now this brand, <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk>
These people were <unk> the film to <unk> forever.
And so the film is explores all of this idea -- <unk> <unk> is <unk> Is it <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I'm a <unk> <unk> <unk> Just <unk> it was more by <unk>
It was <unk> <unk>
But we're not just going to have the sponsor of the brand X brand in the title but we're going to make sure that we would drop all the categories that we can on the film.
Maybe you get a shoe, and it becomes the most cool shoe that you've got to do.
The most cool car that you've driven on the largest movie ever <unk> the best <unk> that you would have <unk> from "The largest film ever <unk>
<unk> <unk> The idea is then to show you the brands as part of life, making them <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> MS: And we actually showed the whole process of how it works.
The <unk> goal is transparency.
You're going to see the whole process in this film.
That's the complete idea, all of film -- beginning to end.
And I would love to help you make it happen.
Robert <unk> you know, it's funny because it's the first time I hear that; it's the most respect for the audience.
<unk> However, I don't know how to <unk> it is going to be the people to that.
<unk> Do you have a <unk> -- I don't know if <unk> is very <unk> but you know how it goes to <unk> <unk> <unk> How much money does it take to do this?
MS: A million and a half million -- <unk> <unk> John <unk> I think it's going to be difficult to meeting with them, but it's certainly going to be worth a couple of big brands a couple of big brands a couple of big brands a couple of big brands to convince you to convince a couple of big scales.
<unk> <unk> knows, maybe for the moment that the movie comes out of us to get out of the film is a lot of <unk>
MS: What do you think that's going to be the answer?
Stuart <unk> Most of the answers will be built.
MS: But it's going to be hard to <unk> by the film or to be I?
JK: Both things.
MS: ... means you're not very optimistic.
So, I got <unk> I need help.
MK: I can help.
MS: All right. <unk> <unk> Awesome.
MK: We have to think about what brands.
MS: Yeah. <unk> That's the <unk> When you look at the people you have to <unk>
MK: We have some places where to go. <unk> <unk> the camera.
MS: I thought that <unk> <unk> meant we have a conversation out of the microphone.
<unk> the camera means "We don't want to know anything about your <unk>
MS: And this was, one by one, all these companies suddenly disappeared.
No wanted to have anything to do with this film.
I was surprised.
They didn't want to know anything with this project.
And I was very <unk> I thought that the concept of advertising, was to introduce the product to as many people as possible, to make people as many people as well as possible.
Especially in the world today this intersection of new media and old media and the stage of separate media, and it's not the idea to tell you with that new vehicle that is going to take the message to the <unk>
No, that's what I thought.
But the problem was, you see, my idea had a <unk> error and that error was this.
Actually there was no such mistake.
There was no mistake at all.
This would have been right.
But the problem was what this image.
See, when you look for <unk> images in Google <unk>   -- this is one of the first images that are introduced.
I like your way to <unk> Sergey <unk> No.
This was the problem: <unk> <unk> or <unk> easily detected or easily <unk> or <unk> easily <unk> which is characterized by the visibility or information, especially in <unk> practices being the last line maybe the biggest problem.
You see, we heard a lot about transparency in these days.
Our politicians <unk> the president -- the <unk> even the <unk> the <unk>
But all of a sudden when it comes to make it really something it changes very suddenly.
But why? Well, transparency day <unk>  like that weird bear that still follows <unk>
It's <unk>   Like this rare rural.
And it's also very risky.
What else is it <unk>
<unk> a whole bowl of <unk> <unk>
That's very risky.
When I started talking to companies and to tell you that we wanted to tell this story and they said, "No, we want it to <unk> <unk> history.
We want to give them a story, but that <unk> <unk> story."
See, when I was a kid, and my father was <unk> in some lie -- and there he was looking at me as I used to say, "Son, there's three sides in every story.
There's your story, and it's my story, and it's the real-time history.
As you see, in this film we wanted to tell the real story.
But with just a company, an agency wanting to help me -- and that just because I knew John Bond and Richard <unk> from many years -- I realized that I would have to go through my own, I would have to take it out and go to companies myself with all my team.
So what I started to realize is suddenly -- that I started to give me <unk> is that when you start to talk to the companies the idea of understanding your brand is a universal problem.
MS: I have friends who make big, giant movies, and others that make small films -- independent films like mine.
And my friends who make Hollywood Hollywood movies say that the reason why their films are so successful is due to the brands associated with them.
And then my friends who make independent films say, "Well, how are we supposed to compete with these big, giant movies of <unk>
And the movie is called "The largest <unk> movie.
How are we going to see specifically <unk> in the movie?
Every time I'm going to go out, every time I open my <unk> you'll see the <unk> <unk>
At any time during an interview with someone I can say "Are you cool for this <unk>
Are you ready? You see a little nervous.
I want to help you to give you it.
Maybe you should get a little bit of this before the <unk>
And then he offered one of these <unk> <unk>
Both <unk> <unk> like <unk> <unk> are going to have their opportunity.
We're going to have so much for man like <unk> solid, <unk> to <unk> like it.
That's the big look.
Now I can answer your questions and give them a look at <unk>
Karen <unk> We're a small brand.
You know, <unk> the kind of smaller movies that we <unk> are rather a <unk> brand.
So we don't have the budget that have other brands.
So do things like this, you know, remembering the people is the reason why this interests us.
MS: What words would you use to describe <unk>
<unk> is in white.
<unk> That's a great question.
Woman: <unk> technology.
MS: Technology is not the way you want to describe something you put into the <unk>
Man: We talk about something bold cool.
I think <unk> is a great word that really puts this category in positive versus <unk> the smell and <unk>
It's really cool.
How do you keep you fresh longer?
Things like those who are <unk> the benefits.
MS: And that's a <unk> company.
What about me? What about a common kind of <unk>
I need to talk to the man of the street, the people like me, to the <unk>
They have to talk about my brand.
MS: How do you define your <unk>
Man: <unk> my <unk>
I don't know.
I like the good clothing.
Woman: To revive the '80s, <unk> <unk> unless it is <unk>
MS: All right, what is the brand <unk>
<unk> One only <unk> <unk> Man: I guess the kind of gender, the style I have would be like a <unk> <unk>
I like a lot of dark colors -- a lot of gray and things like that.
I usually carry knobs like sunglasses, or <unk> and I like the crystals and the same.
Woman: If Dan was a brand that could be a <unk> <unk> Mercedes <unk>
Man 2: The brand that I am, I would call it <unk> <unk>
Woman 2: So on some <unk> part of it, in part <unk> <unk> I don't know.
Man 3: I am the kind of money.
<unk> toys for pets in the country and in the world.
So I guess that's my brand.
In my little sector, that's my brand.
Man 4: My brand is FedEx out because it <unk> the <unk>
Man 5: Park. <unk> failed.
Is that something?
<unk> I'm a <unk>
<unk> I'm <unk>
MS: Well, we can't all be brand, Tom, but I often lie at the intersection of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
I realized I needed an expert.
I needed somebody who could go into my head, someone who could help me understand what they call the <unk> <unk>
And I found a company called <unk> <unk> in Pittsburgh.
They helped companies like <unk> <unk> <unk> to discover that <unk> personality.
If they were able to do it for them, they could surely do it for me.
<unk> <unk> pictures, right?
MS: Yeah. The first picture is a familiar picture.
A: <unk> a little bit about how it relates to your thoughts and feelings your way of being.
MS: These people shape my way to see the world.
A: <unk> in that world.
MS: That world? I think your world is the world in which we <unk> like the people around you, your family, the way you live your life, the work you do.
All of those things come up and start in a place and in my case where it comes and start in my family in West Virginia.
A: What's the next thing you want to talk about.
MS: The next one is "This was the best day of my life."
A: How does this relate to your thoughts, feelings and your way to be?
MS: It's like who I'd like to be.
I like different things.
I like things weird -- I like weird things.
A: <unk> <unk> to do what is that for us?
What's the <unk> What is the <unk>
Why is it important to <unk> What is the <unk>
It was a little bit about that.
It's a little bit more than you, which is not who you are.
What other <unk> have you <unk>
You have to be afraid. In what kind of Russian mountain are you?
MS: <unk> <unk> Thank you.)
A: Thank you for your patience. Great <unk> Yes. Yeah. Thank you very much.) All right.
MS: Yeah, I don't know what's going to come out of this.
There was plenty of madness to all this.
<unk> <unk> The first thing I saw was this idea that there are two different sides but <unk> on your personality of <unk> brand Morgan <unk> is a <unk> brand.
It was very well together.
And I think there's almost a paradox in them.
And I think some companies will only be stuck in one of their strong points or in the other instead of focusing on both.
A lot of companies tend to -- and it is nature <unk> to avoid the things that they're not <unk> they avoid fear, those elements, and you actually stop them and make it positive to you, and it's nice to see that.
What other brands are this?
The first here is the classical Apple.
And you can also see here to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
Now there are playful marks and brands -- those things that have gone and come but a <unk> brand is pretty powerful.
MS: A <unk> <unk> What's your <unk>
If somebody asks you to take your brand identity -- your personality personality -- what would be?
You're an <unk> <unk> you're somebody who makes blood <unk>
Or are you more of an attribute of <unk>
A little bit more <unk> <unk> <unk>
The attributes of <unk> are like being playful as being fresh as the <unk> contemporary <unk> or <unk> as <unk> <unk> fast or <unk> <unk> <unk> magical or mystic as <unk>
Or are you more of <unk> <unk>
You're aware, sophisticated as <unk>
You're <unk> traditional <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
You're <unk> stable, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> or wise -- like the Dalai Lama or <unk>
In the course of this film, we had over 500 companies, <unk> and <unk> who said <unk> didn't want to be part of this project.
They didn't want to have anything to do with this film, mainly because they wouldn't have control, they would have no control over the final product.
They allowed us to tell the story of the <unk> and we got to tell the story in this movie of how you can now use MRI and magnetic resonance to identify the desire centers in the brain as much for commercial marketing as they can.
We went to San Paulo where they have banned advertising, to the open.
In the entire city for the last five years, there's no <unk> there is no <unk> there is no <unk>
And we went to school districts where businesses are going to go into schools with business problems in the U.S.
The amazing thing for me is that the projects I've had the biggest answer or the ones I've had more success are the ones I interacted with things directly.
And that's what these brands.
<unk> the <unk> took their <unk> and they said maybe these agencies don't have my best interest in mind.
I'm going to deal with the artist.
I'm going to work with him to create something different, something that is going to do the people that are going to challenge the way we look at the world.
And how does it have left? They felt success?
Well, since the movie was sent out in the <unk> Festival let's take a look.
According to <unk> the movie was sent out in January, and since then -- and this is not <unk> we've had 900 million impressions in the media for this film.
This is about a period of two weeks and a half.
That's just in <unk> no press, no TV.
The film is still not <unk>
It's still not online. It's not in <unk>
It's not even presented in other countries yet.
Ultimately, this film has already started making momentum.
And it's not wrong because almost all the agencies we talk about to do with their customers is not part.
I have always believed that if you were going to get the risks, that in those risks there are opportunities.
I think when you pull people out of this to failure.
I think when you train your employees at the risk of risk is preparing their own company to be <unk>
I feel that what has to happen to move forward is we need to encourage people to <unk>
We need to encourage people to be afraid of the opportunities that they can <unk>
Ultimately, going forward, I think we have to give it to fear.
We have to put that bear in a cage.
<unk> fear <unk> the risk.
From a <unk> at the time, we have to embrace the risk.
And ultimately, we have to keep transparency.
Today, more than ever a bit of honesty is going to go a long way.
And I said this, with honesty and transparency, all of my talk -- the <unk> has been introduced by my good friends of <unk> who by <unk> bought the rights of the name in <unk>
<unk> <unk> big data in big opportunities for companies around the world.
<unk> has <unk> <unk>
Thank you very much people.
June Cohen: So, <unk> on behalf of the transparency, which happened exactly with those <unk>
MS: It's a fantastic question.
In my pocket I have a check on behalf of the TED organization, the Foundation, and a check for <unk> to be applied to my attendance for TED next year.
The idea behind the computer worm is actually very simple.
We don't want Iran to get the nuclear bomb.
Their biggest asset to develop nuclear weapons is the <unk> plant.
The gray boxes you see are real control systems.
If we can compromise these systems that control speeds and <unk> we can cause a lot of problems with the record.
The gray boxes don't use <unk> software -- they're a completely different technology.
But if we put an effective virus for Windows in a portable computer used by an engineer to set up this gray, then we are smart.
This is the plan behind <unk>
We started with a <unk> <unk>
The <unk> enters the gray box -- damages <unk> and nuclear program is <unk> mission.
It's easy, yeah?
I want to tell you how we discovered this.
When we started researching <unk> six months ago, the purpose was completely unknown.
The only thing I knew is that it's very, very complex in the part of the <unk> the <unk> used multiple vulnerabilities <unk>
It seemed to want to do something with these colored boxes -- these control systems.
That struck us attention, and we started an experiment where we infect our environment with <unk> and we saw what was going on with this.
So they got very strange things.
<unk> was <unk> like a lab rat in which he didn't like our <unk> <unk> but I didn't want to eat.
I had no sense for me.
And then to experiment with different flavors of cheese, I realized, and I thought, "This is a <unk> attack.
It's completely <unk>
The <unk> is looking for active in the gray box if you find a specific configuration and even if the program is trying to infect it is actually working on that place: in the time.
If not, you don't do anything.
So that called my attention, and we started working on this almost 24 hours a day, because we said, "We don't know what the <unk> is.
Could it be, say, for example, a U.S. energy plant or a chemical plant in Germany.
You'd better get the goal soon.
So we pulled out and <unk> the attack, and we found that I was <unk> in two <unk> bombs a small and a big one.
We also saw that they were very armed with very professionally of people who obviously had all the internal information.
It would take all the dots to attack.
You probably even know how much they did -- the operator.
So you know everything.
And if you've heard that the <unk> <unk> is complex and high technology, let me tell you, the burden is very complex.
It's very above everything we've seen before.
So here you see a sample of this attack.
We're talking about 15 thousand lines of code.
It looks pretty much like the old language.
I want to tell you how we could find sense to this code.
What we were looking at at first were calls called the functions of the system, because we know what they do.
And we were looking at <unk> and data structures and tried to deal with it with the real world, with potential targets of real world.
We need theories about how we can pass or <unk>
To get to theories about goals, we remember that it's definitely a violent <unk> it must be a <unk> <unk> and it's certainly located in Iran, because it's where most infections has been <unk>
They are not several thousand targets in that area.
It basically boils down to the nuclear power plant of <unk> and the <unk> plant.
So I said to my <unk> <unk> a list of all the experts in <unk> and energy plants between our <unk>
I called them and I went to them in an effort for <unk> their experience with what we found in code and data.
And it worked pretty well.
So we were able to associate the little digital <unk> with control of the <unk>
<unk> is that cell phone inside the <unk> that black object you see.
If you run the speed of this <unk> you certainly can <unk> and even make the <unk> explode.
What we also saw is that the goal of the attack was going to make it slow and <unk> in an obvious effort to <unk> the nest engineers so they couldn't solve this quickly.
We try to figure out the big digital <unk> looking very close to the data and their structures.
So for example, the number <unk> <unk> in that code, you can't <unk>
I started researching scientific literature about how these <unk> are built in <unk> and found that they're <unk> in what's called a <unk> and each waterfall contains <unk> <unk>
That made sense, there was a coincidence.
And it got better yet.
These <unk> in Iran are <unk> in 15 parts <unk>
And guess what do we find in the code of <unk>
A almost <unk> structure.
So again, that was a good coincidence.
This gave us a lot of confidence in understanding what we had in our hands.
For no <unk> it wasn't like this.
The results have been out after several weeks of hard work.
<unk> <unk> in <unk> and we had to go back to start.
Even so, we discovered that both digital <unk> would be only one and same goal, but from different <unk>
<unk> <unk> is taking a <unk> and making the <unk> and <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and manipulating it.
In <unk> we're very confident that we have determined what the <unk> is.
It's <unk> and it's just <unk>
We don't have to worry about the other goals are going to be <unk> by <unk>
So here I show you some really interesting things that we saw was really <unk>
There is the gray, and the top box is the <unk>
What this thing is doing is <unk> the values of the sensors for example, of pressure sensors, and the metal sensors and provides <unk> code, which is still running during the attack, with false data.
And believe it or not, these false entry data is <unk> by <unk>
It's like the Hollywood movies where, during the <unk> the security camera is feeding <unk>
It's great <unk>
The idea here is obviously not just <unk> the operators in the room of control.
It's really much more dangerous and <unk>
The idea is <unk> a system of digital security.
We need digital security systems where a human operator could not act fast.
For example, in an energy plant, when the big steam turbine goes away from speed, you have to open from escape <unk> in a <unk>
Obviously, this can't make it a human operator, right?
That's where we need digital security.
And when they're <unk> then you can spend bad things.
The plant can exploit.
And not the <unk> or the security system is <unk>
That scares you.
But it can be worse.
What I'm going to say is very important.
Think about this. This is <unk>
It has nothing to see, specifically, with <unk> <unk>
It could work too, for example, in an energy plant, or in an <unk>
It's <unk>
And you don't have <unk> <unk> that disseminate this burden with a <unk> key as we saw in the case of <unk>
You could also use the conventional technology of worms for <unk>
It was possible as possible.
And if you do that, you know, with what we're going to do is with a <unk> of mass destruction.
That's the consequence we have to face.
Unfortunately, the biggest number of targets for such attacks is not in the Middle East.
It's in the United States and Japan.
All the green areas are spaces.
We have to deal with the consequences and the better that we start doing now.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: I have a question.
<unk> has been public in many sides that people assumed that <unk> is the main entity behind this.
What's your <unk>
Ralph <unk> OK, really want to hear this?
Yeah. <unk>
My view is that the <unk> is involved, but the engine is not <unk>
The engine behind this is the <unk> superpower there.
There's one thing, and that's the United States, fortunately, <unk>
Because, in another way, our problems would be even older.
CA: Thank you for <unk> Thank you, <unk>
I want you to imagine a robot that can be able to take a robot and give them <unk> or another one that makes users of chairs and come back and walk.
In <unk> <unk> we call these robots, <unk>
There are nothing different from something that goes in in the morning, gives you a great force that also increases its speed, and help, for example, to handle the balance.
It's actually the real integration of man and the machine.
But not only that -- it can integrate and connected it to the universe and with other <unk>
This is not an idea.
So to show you now in what we're working on to talk about the American soldier that, on average, it has to take over their back a load of 45 pounds, and it's going to be <unk>
Obviously, this leads to some important complications -- injuries on the back, in 30 percent of the soldiers -- with chronic chronic damage to back.
We decided to look at this challenge and create a exoskeleton that could help handle the matter.
Let me introduce you to <unk> -- or <unk> Human <unk>
Soldier: With the exoskeleton -- I can <unk> 90 pounds of a piece of paper for many hours.
Their flexible design allows you to put in <unk> <unk> and running movements with great <unk>
I know what I want to do, or where I want to go, and then it increases my strength and my <unk>
<unk> <unk> We're ready, with our industrial partner to produce this device, this new <unk> this year.
I mean, it's a reality.
Let's go back to the <unk> users of wheels, about what I'm particularly passionate about.
There are 68 million people based on wheels, around the world.
Like one percent of the total population.
And this is a really conservative.
We talk about something that happens very often, very young people, with damage in the column that will start -- to 20, 30 or 40 years -- they collide on a wall and the wheelchair turns out to be your only choice.
We also talk about the population that gets married quickly.
His only option, many times -- for a brain injury or some other, is the wheelchair.
And this has been over the last 500 years, from its successful <unk> as I should recognize.
So we decided to start by writing a new chapter about mobility.
Let me introduce you to the <unk> which is using Amanda <unk> who 19 years ago had an injury in the neocortical column, and as a result, couldn't go back for 19 years, so far.
Amanda <unk> Thank you.
EB: Amanda is using our <unk> that <unk>
It has a few sensors.
It was completely <unk> in crutches that send signals to the computer on board, on the back.
There are also batteries that give power to engines in the <unk> and on the knees, and they do it with this soft and very natural.
AB: I was 24 at the top of my life, when, by a stranger in the air, in the air, skiing down it was <unk>
In a fraction of the second, I lost all the feeling and all the movement that went down.
Shortly after that, a doctor went into my room in the hospital, and he said, <unk> never come to <unk>
That happened 19 years ago.
So I stole it up to the last bit of hope of my being.
<unk> technology since then, has allowed me to learn how to <unk> it costs down in <unk> climbing rocks and even ride a <unk>
But they hadn't invented anything that allowed me to walk, so far.
Thank you.
EB: As you can see, we have the technology, we have the platforms to sit and talk to you.
It's in our hands, and we have all the potential here to change the lives of future generations -- not just of soldiers, but after Amanda, and all of the users of lawn chairs all of us.
AB: Thank you.
I've just returned from a community that has the secret of human survival.
It's a place where women have <unk> practice to say hello, and the game is the order of the day -- where fun is serious.
And no, it's not the festival from Man <unk> or San Francisco.
Ladies and gentlemen, you know their cousins.
This is the world of wild bonobos in the forests of Congo.
The bonobos are along with chimpanzees, their closest living relatives, closest relatives, more often.
That means that we all share a common ancestor, an evolutionary grandmother that lived about six million years ago.
Now, chimpanzees are known for their <unk>
But unfortunately, we've done very focused on this aspect of human evolution.
But the bonobos show us the other side of the coin.
Whereas chimpanzees are dominated by large, <unk> society is in charge of females with power.
These guys have created something special because this leads to a very tolerant society where the mortal violence hasn't been observed.
But unfortunately, the bonobos are the least <unk> of the great apes.
They live in the depths of the <unk> rainforest and it's been very difficult to <unk>
Congo is a <unk> an extraordinary biodiversity and beauty, but also the heart of the <unk> <unk> scenario of a violent conflict that has been sustained for decades, and caused almost as many deaths as the First World War.
No wonder that this destruction will also put in danger of the Bonobo.
<unk> meat and deforestation make it not filling up and a stadium with the bonobos who stay in the world -- and honestly, we're not sure about it.
However, in this land of violence and chaos you can hear the laughter hidden in the trees.
Who are these <unk>
We know them as the apes and the love, not <unk> because they have <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> to drive conflict and solve social problems.
I'm not saying that this is the solution to all the problems of humanity because the life of the Bonobo Bonobo is more than the <unk> <unk>
<unk> as humans, like humans, love to play throughout their lifetime.
Play is not just a game of children.
For us and for them the game is fundamental to establish ties and encourage <unk>
With him learning <unk> and we learn the rules of play.
The game increases creativity and resilience and has to do with the generation of <unk> diversity of interactions, diversity of behaviors.
And when you look at the bionic <unk> you see the roots and the same thing of laughter, the dance and the human ritual and the human ritual and the human ritual and the human ritual and the human ritual and the human ritual and the human.
The game is the glue that unites us.
I don't know how you play it, but I want to show you a couple of unique videos just taken from the wild.
First, it's a <unk> <unk> game, and I don't talk about soccer.
Here we have a female and a young male in the middle of a <unk>
Look at what's doing it.
Could it be the evolutionary origin of the phrase, "Is it <unk> <unk>
I just think that in this case to him, right?
Yeah.
So the sexual game is common as much in bonobos as humans.
And this video really is interesting because we have this video that is really interesting because it shows the invention of bringing unusual elements into the game -- like the <unk> and also how the game needs trust and <unk> <unk> and at the same time is the most fun.
But the game is <unk>
The game is <unk> it can adopt many ways, some of which are more <unk> <unk> <unk> maybe the place where the wonder.
And I want you to <unk> this is <unk> a young female who is playing with <unk> water.
I think that we sometimes play ourselves, and we explore the limits of our inner worlds and outside of our external worlds.
And it's that playful curiosity that drives us to explore, to interact. And then the unexpected connections that we form are the real <unk> of creativity.
These are just small samples of understanding that Bonobo gives us from our past and present.
But they also have a secret for our future, a future where we have to adapt to a more and more difficult world with greater creativity and cooperation.
The secret is that the game is the key to these abilities.
In other words, the game is our <unk>
To adapt to a world that changes we need to play.
But let's end up at the top of our game?
The game is not <unk>
The game is essential.
For bonobos and humans for the same, life is not just cruel and <unk>
When it looks at least appropriate to play, you can be the moments in which the most <unk>
So fellow primates, we accept this gift of evolution and play together as <unk> creativity, friendship and wonder.
Thank you.
In New York I'm responsible for development of a nonprofit organization called Robin <unk>
When I'm not fighting poverty, <unk> fires like a captain of the captain in a fire body.
And in our city, where volunteers were given to a highly skilled staff in the <unk> you have to get to the fire site very soon to go into action.
I remember my first fire.
I was the second volunteer on the site, so I had a fairly high probability of going.
But there was still a race to foot on the other volunteers to get to the captain and figure out what our task was.
When I found the <unk> I was <unk> in a conversation with the owner that certainly went through one of the worst days of his life.
We were at the full night, and she was standing outside in the rain, under a <unk> in him, <unk> while his house was on fire.
The other volunteer I had just arrived before I was before me, <unk> <unk> <unk>  came to the captain first to the captain and he asked him to go in and save the owner of your house.
The <unk> I was <unk> <unk>
There was a lawyer or a <unk> of money who, during the rest of his life, would have to tell the people who entered a burning building to save a live living because I won for five seconds.
Well, I was the following.
The captain made me a <unk>
He said, <unk> I need to get between the house.
I need you to <unk> <unk> the fire, and then bring this woman a couple of shoes."
I got it.
It was not exactly what I hoped but <unk> I got the stairs, at the end of the hall, which happened to the firemen and went to the firemen and that height and less had finished off the fire and entered the main room in search for a couple of shoes.
I know what you're thinking, but I'm not a hero.
I took my burden on the staircase where I met my <unk> and the gorgeous door on the front door.
We got out of the house the treasures of the house where, as I would expect, her trove got much more attention than mine.
A few weeks later, the department received a letter from a house <unk> by the brave brave effort to save his house.
The kindness that she looked at the other was that someone had reached even a couple of shoes.
Both in my calling on Robin <unk> as in my <unk> as a voluntary fireman is witness by generosity and kindness on a <unk> scale, but also <unk> acts of <unk>
And you know what I've learned?
Everything has its importance.
So when I look at this room in the people who have achieved, or are there to do remarkable levels of success I'd like to remind you this: not wait.
Don't wait for the first million to make the difference in somebody's life.
If you have something to give, it would be now.
<unk> food in a dining room, a <unk> park.
Is it mentors.
Not every day we're going to have the opportunity to save someone's life, but every day we're going to be able to influence someone.
So you enter the <unk> <unk> the shoes.
Thank you.
Bruno Giussani: Mark, Mark, comes back.
Mark <unk> Thank you.
This may seem strange, but I'm a big fan of the concrete block.
The first concrete blocks built in <unk> with a very simple <unk> modules of a fixed measure that fit each other.
Very quickly, these became the building unit in the world.
They have allowed us to build larger things that we, as buildings or bridges, a brick at the time.
These blocks have become the pillars of our time.
Almost a hundred years later, in 1947, the <unk> came up with this.
He was called <unk> <unk>
And in a few years, the <unk> blocks came to every home.
It's been estimated that over 400 billion or 75 bricks per person on the planet.
You don't have to be an engineer to build beautiful buildings or homes.
<unk> made it accessible.
<unk> simply adopted the concrete block of concrete in the world, and it became a fundamental piece of our imagination.
Meanwhile, exactly that same year, in the Bell, the next revolution was about to <unk> the new block block.
The transistor was a small plastic unit that would lead us from a world of aesthetic bricks stacked up about others to a world where everything was interactive.
Like the concrete block -- the transistor allows you to create much greater and more complex, a brick at the same time.
But there's a <unk> difference. The transistor was only for experts.
I personally don't know that the building blocks of our time are reserved for experts, so I decided to change it.
Eight years ago, when I was at the Media Lab, I started exploring the idea of bringing engineers to the hands of the engineers and designers.
A few years ago, I started developing <unk>
I'm going to show you how they work.
<unk> are electronic modules each with a specific function.
They're <unk> to be light, sound, motors and sensors.
And the best of everything is they join through magnets.
So you can't put in a wrong way.
And the bricks have a colors.
The green is the right thing, the blue is the stream, the pink is the input and the orange color is the wire.
So you just have to assemble a blue with one green one and very quickly you can start to make bigger circuits.
A blue with one green with one green is making light.
We can put a button in the middle and we have a <unk>
If we change the button for a pulse, that's here, and now we have a <unk> light.
And we would take this <unk> to create more impact and we have a noise.
I'm going to stop this.
So beyond the simple game, they're actually very powerful.
Instead of having to program, connecting and <unk> <unk> it allows us to program using very simple <unk>
To make it faster or slower, simply <unk> this button that makes the pulse faster or slower.
The idea behind <unk> is that it's a growing collection.
We want all of the interactions in the world to move into bricks to use.
<unk> sounds, solar cells, <unk> everything must be accessible.
We have given the kids to get them to play with them.
And it's been an incredible experience.
The best thing is how they start to understand the electronics from every day they don't learn in schools.
For example, how does one light light works or why the door of an elevator is held open, or how an iPod responds to touch.
We've also led to design schools.
So for example, designers without any electronics in electronics start playing with <unk> as a material.
Here you can see, with paper bottles and <unk> we have <unk> <unk>
<unk>  A few weeks ago, we took the designers from the School of Rhode Island School -- who have no experience in engineering, just in cardboard, and paper and said, <unk> something.
Here's an example of a project that has done, a <unk> cannon on the movement.
But wait, here's my favorite project.
It's a <unk> made of dough that is afraid of darkness.
For these engineers, <unk> became another material, electronics became another material.
And we want this material to be in the reach of everyone.
So <unk> has open code.
You can visit the website, you download all the design files and <unk>
We want to encourage a world of creators, inventors and collaborators because this world in which we live, this interaction world is ours.
So ahead and things.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk to you today about unexpected discoveries.
I work in the solar technology.
And my little company is looking to get involved with the environment focusing on the environment.
<unk> collaboration.
This is a little video of what we do.
<unk> wait for a moment.
Can you take a little bit of <unk>
<unk> we can keep the video on one side.
No.
This is not ...
All right.
Technology is ...
Oh, I look at time?
All right. Thank you very much.
A couple of years ago, I launched an initiative to recruit the best designers and technicians to take a year and work in an environment that represents almost everything that's supposed to be done in government.
The initiative was called <unk> for <unk> and it would be like <unk> <unk>
And we took a few members every year and we put them to work with the <unk>
Instead of sending them to the Third World we send them to the wild world.
They made great <unk> they worked with <unk>
Their task is to show the possibilities of today's technology.
So meet <unk>
It's a <unk> in the city of Boston.
Here it appears as if I look at a quote, but what really looks for me is that somebody is going to be caught up in the snow because he knows it's not very good by running fires when it's covered for a meter of snow.
How did it get to ask for help from this way so <unk>
Last year in Boston we had a team of members of <unk> for <unk>
They were there in February and at that moment, a lot of the last year.
They realized that the city never wiped these <unk>
But one of the members called Erik <unk> I noticed something else -- that citizens <unk> with <unk> the sidewalks right in front of them.
So it did like any good programmer, I developed an app.
It's a nice application where you can adopt a <unk>
You take <unk> when you <unk>
When you do that, you put a name, in this case he put him <unk>
If you don't do that, someone can <unk>
I mean, it has a visual component.
It's a modest application.
It's probably the smallest of the 21 applications -- <unk> last year.
But it does something that no other technology in the <unk> government.
It stretches viral form.
A responsible care system from the city of <unk> when you see this app that I could use it, not for snow, but for the citizens to hold off the tsunami.
It's very important to work these <unk> of tsunami, but people steals the batteries.
That's why they ask the citizens to <unk>
And then Seattle decided to use it to make the citizens <unk> <unk>
And Chicago just launched it to make people <unk> to clean sidewalks when they were born.
So now we know about nine cities that plan to use it.
And this has been spread without <unk> in a organic and natural way.
If you know a little bit of government technology, you will know that this isn't normally happening.
The acquisition of software typically takes a couple of years.
Last year in Boston we had a team working on a project that took three people for two and a half months.
It was a tool for parents to choose the best public school for their children.
Then they told us that they had done by the normal channels would have taken at least two years and another two million dollars.
And that's nothing.
There's now a project in the power court of California that even the time has two million dollars and it doesn't work.
And there are projects like this in every level of government.
So an app that you program in a couple of days and it spreads in a viral form is a kind of shot of warning to the institution of government.
It suggests to the best ways of working, not as in private companies like many people think it should be.
It's not as a technological company, but more like the Internet itself.
I mean, without constraints, in open and <unk>
And that's important.
But the most important thing about this app is that it represents the way to address the question of the government that has the new <unk> not as a problem of an institution <unk> but as a collective action problem.
And that's really good because it turns out we are very good at the collective action with digital technology.
And there is a very large community of people who are building the tools to work together with efficacy.
And it's not just <unk> for <unk> but there are hundreds of people around the country that contribute to <unk> apps every day in their own communities.
They haven't been given to the government.
You feel a lot of frustration to that but they don't get <unk>
And these people know something we've lost from view.
And that is that if we just leave the feelings about politics, line in the <unk> <unk> <unk> and all those other things that they are <unk> the government is, essentially, in the words of Tim <unk> "What we do together because they alone don't know.
Now, a lot of people left the government.
If you are one of those people, I would ask you to do it because things are changing.
The politics didn't take the government itself.
And because the ultimately would deliver from us -- remember that of <unk> the <unk> The way to think about it will affect the way that change.
I didn't know a lot of government when I started with this.
And as a lot of people thought the government was to choose people to make them <unk>
Well, after two years I've come to the conclusion that the government is, especially about <unk>
This is the center of care of services and information.
It's the place that serves the phone calls if you mark around the U.S.
Scott <unk> this call.
He entered the basis of official knowledge.
I found nothing. It started with animal control.
And he finally said, "Hey, you can open the gates of the house and put music right and see if they were <unk>
And it worked. So for Scott.
But that wasn't the end of the <unk>
Boston is not a phone center.
It has a web application, and the mobile phone, called <unk> <unk>
I don't know that app.
It was the work of very smart people in the Office of New York City <unk>
One day, this really happened this <unk> <unk> on my bucket of trash. I don't know if it's dead.
How do I do for <unk>
The dynamics of <unk> <unk> is different.
Scott was talking in person.
In <unk> <unk> everything is public, so everybody can see this.
In this case, he saw a neighbor.
The next report said, "I went to the place, I found the garbage bucket behind the house.
<unk> Yeah. <unk> Yes.
And I went home.
Good evening, sweet sweet <unk>
Quite simple.
This is great. It's the confluence of the digital and the physical.
And it's also a great example of the income for the government to volunteer volunteer <unk>
But it's also a great example of government as a platform.
And here I don't necessarily mean the definition of technology of platform.
I talk about a platform for people to get married and help others.
So a citizen helped another but here the government had a key role.
I connected the two people.
And it could be connected to the government services to be necessary but the neighbor is a better and cheaper alternative than government services.
When a neighbor helps each other, <unk> the communities.
If we call the control of animals, that costs a lot of money.
One important thing we need to think about the government is that it's not the same as politics.
A lot of people do it, but think that one is the input of the other.
That our input to the government system is the vote.
How many times have you chosen a political <unk> sometimes we spend a lot of energy to choose a new political leader, and then we hope that the government is going to take our values and <unk> our needs, but then we don't see changes.
That's because the government is like an immense ocean and politics is a shallow shallow layer.
It's what we call <unk>
And we say that word with a lot of contempt.
But it's that <unk> that keeps us that belongs to us that we funded as something that is operating on our <unk> that other thing, and in consequence we're losing the power.
People believe that politics is sexy.
If we want this institution to work, we have to make the bureaucracy sexy.
Because that's where the real work of government.
We need to collaborate with the machinery of government.
That makes the movement <unk>
They have <unk> them.
It's a group of citizens concerned that a very detailed report of <unk> pages in response to the request of <unk> <unk> about the financial reform project.
That's not political activism is a political activism for us.
And for those of us who have been dealing with government, it's time to ask us what world we want to leave to our children.
You have to see the huge challenges that they will have to face.
Do you really believe that we have to go without solving the institution that can act on behalf of <unk>
We cannot without government, we need to be more effective.
The good news is that with technology is possible to rethink the root function of government so that it can be expanding <unk> into civil society.
There is a generation that grew up with the Internet and knows that it's not so difficult to act <unk> you only have to articulate the systems in the right way.
The average age of our members is 28 years old, so I -- I'm a generation older than many of them.
This is a generation that has grown up taking the word and giving that almost for granted.
They're not giving that battle that we all face about who is going to be <unk> they're all going to talk about.
They can express their opinions in any channel at the same time and they do.
So when they face the government problem, they don't care too much to hear their voices.
They're using our hands.
They bring hands to the work to program applications that make better government better.
And those applications allow us to use our hands to improve our communities.
It can be wiping out a fire <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a garbage <unk>
Of course we were always able to cleaned up those hydrants and a lot of people doing it.
But these applications are like digital <unk> that we're not only consumers, not only are consumers of government that we pay taxes and get services.
We are more than that: we're citizens.
And we're not going to fix the government until we don't make the <unk>
So I want to ask all of you, when it comes to the important things that we have to do together, all of us together, we're going to be a crowd of voices, or we'll be a crowd of hands?
Thank you.
This is for me a real honor.
I've spent most of the time in prisons, prisons and death.
I've spent most of my life in communities in community communities and places where there is a lot of despair.
And I'll be here at TED watching and hearing these stimulus has given me a lot of energy.
One of the things I've noticed in this short time is that TED has identity.
And the things that are saying here has impact around the world.
Sometimes if something comes from TED, it makes sense and a force that would not have another way.
I say this because I think identity is <unk> important.
Here we've seen fantastic presentations here.
And I think we've learned that the words of a teacher can have a lot of sense, but if they teach feeling, you can have a special meaning.
A doctor can do good things, <unk> if it's <unk> it can get a lot more.
So I want to talk about the power of identity.
I didn't really learn this in the practice of right, my job.
I learned from my grandmother.
I grew up in an African-American family of a African-American family dominated by a <unk> which was my grandmother.
It was hard, it was strong, it had power.
It was the last word in every discussion in the family.
She <unk> a lot of the <unk> in our home.
It was a daughter of people who had been slaves.
His parents were born in slavery in Virginia over the <unk>
She was born on the <unk> and his experience with slavery <unk> the way the world looked like.
She was hard, but it was also <unk>
When I was a little bit old and looked at it, she was approaching me and gave me a good hug.
It was so strong I could barely breathe and then <unk>
One or two hours later, I came back to <unk> I was approaching and said, <unk> you still feel my <unk>
And if he said no, I was going to tell him again, and if she said yes, I was left to peace.
I had this human quality that makes you always wish to be close to it.
The only problem is that I had 10 children.
My mother was the least of 10.
Sometimes, when I was going to spend a time with it, it wasn't easy to catch your time and your attention.
My cousins were running everywhere.
I remember when I was eight or nine years old, I woke up one morning, I went to the room and there were all my cousins.
My grandmother was on the other side of the room and looked at me <unk>
At first, I thought it was a game.
And then I looked at it and she said, but she was really serious.
After 15 or 20 minutes, she stood up, I went through the room, I took me from my hand, and he said, "Come on <unk> The two are going to be <unk>
I remember this as if it was yesterday.
I'll never forget it.
It took me out and he said, <unk> I'll tell you something, but you can't tell anybody to say.
I said, "It's okay, <unk>
She said, "Now I don't know it, I said, <unk>
And then I sat down, he looked at me and said, "I want you to know that I've been <unk>
And <unk> "I think you're <unk>
He said, "I think you can do anything you like."
I'll never forget it.
Then he said to me, "Just I want you to give me three things, <unk>
I said, <unk> <unk>
And he said, "The first thing I want you to talk about, you know, you want your mother."
<unk> "She is my <unk> and you have to <unk> you know, always <unk>
As I went to my mom, I said, "Yes, <unk> I do."
Then he said, "The second thing I want you to talk about, is that you will always do the right thing if the right thing is going to be done.
I thought about it, and I said, "Yes, <unk> So I do."
Then he finally said, "I'm the third thing I want you to tell me is that I never <unk> <unk>
I was nine years old, and I said, "Yes, <unk> I do."
I grew up in the field, in <unk> I have a brother a year older than a younger year.
When I was 14  15, one day my brother came home with a <unk> package -- I don't know where the <unk> grabbed me to my sister and me and went to the forest.
We just get making the <unk>
He took a sip of beer, he offered him to my sister, she took a little bit and offered me to me.
I said, "No, no, no. All right. You <unk> but I'm not going to take <unk>
My brother said, <unk> today we do it, and you always do the same thing as us.
I already took something, your sister is doing a <unk>
I said, "No. I wouldn't feel good. You can <unk>
Then my brother looked at me <unk>
And he said, "What's going on? Take a <unk>
I got a look at the strength of the force and <unk> "Oh, not that you're still thinking about the conversation with <unk>
I said, "But what are you talking about?"
He said, <unk> tells all the grandchildren that are <unk>
I was <unk>
I have to admit something to you.
I'll tell you something that I probably shouldn't say.
I know this is spread <unk>
But I have 52 years old, and I can admit that I've never taken a drop of alcohol.
I'm not saying this to be a <unk> I say it for the power of identity.
When we create the right kind of identity, we say things to others that they really don't make sense.
We can't get them to do things that they don't believe to be able to do.
I think my grandmother believed that all their grandchildren were special.
My grandfather had been prisoner during the <unk>
My others died of age-related diseases related to alcohol.
And these were the things that were the ones who, according to it, we needed to <unk>
Now, trying to talk about our criminal justice system.
This country is today very different from what it was 40 years ago.
In <unk> there were 300,000 prisoners.
Today, there is 2.3 million.
In America we have the highest incarceration rate in the world.
We have seven million people on parole.
And this massive incarceration in my view, has changed fundamentally our world.
In poor communities or black, it's so much <unk> so much despair, by these facts.
One in three black and the 30 years is in jail or freedom in parole.
In urban <unk> all over the country, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Baltimore Washington, 50 to 60 percent of all young people in color are in jail or freedom or parole.
Our system is not only distorted in front of race, it's also about poverty.
In this country we have a court system that makes you much better if you're rich and <unk> than if you're poor and innocent.
It's not <unk> it's wealth that affects the results.
And it seems to us very <unk>
The politics of fear and anger makes us believe that these are not our problems with us.
We're on line.
It seems interesting.
We're looking at our work some very curious developments in our job.
In my state, in Alabama, as well as in other states, they would fall out of rights.
Now in Alabama, the <unk> of male male population has definitely lost the right to vote.
And if we put it back to the next 10 years the level of loss of rights to be as high as before they were <unk> the law of the right to vote.
We have this amazing silence.
I represent children.
Many of my customers are very young.
America is the only country in the world where it was sentence to 13 years to die in prison.
We have in this country prison for children, without a chance to go out.
Now we're in process of some <unk>
The only country in the world.
They were beating people in death row people.
This issue of death penalty is interesting.
And in some sense, you have to think that the final question is, people deserve to die by <unk>
A very sensitive question.
But you can think about another way about how we are in our identity.
There's another form of <unk> it's not about deciding whether people deserve to die for the crimes, but if we deserve to kill.
This is interesting.
The death penalty in America is defined by error.
In every nine people <unk> has been identified one who is innocent and <unk> from the death row of death.
One rate of error, <unk> an innocent one of every nine.
This is interesting.
In aviation it would not be allowed to ever be able to fly airplanes if every nine <unk> would have been <unk>
But somehow we get rid of the problem.
It's not our problem.
It's not our burden.
It's not our struggle.
I talk a lot about these things.
I talk about race and this issue of whether we deserve to kill.
It's interesting that in my classes with students -- I talk about slavery.
I talk to you about terrorism, the time that started at the end of the rebuilding and lasted until the Second World War.
We don't really know a lot about this.
But for the black Americans in this country, it was an defined time by terror.
In many communities people were afraid to be <unk>
They were worried about being <unk>
The threat of terror was what defined their lives.
Now there are older people who get me close to me and say, "Mr. Stevenson, you're starting to come up with talks, makes you ask people to say that in our history we deal with terrorism, after <unk>
They ask me to say, "No. Say that we grew up with that."
The era of terrorism was obviously, with segregation and decades of <unk> racial and separation.
In this country we have a dynamic that we don't like to talk about our problems.
We don't like to talk about our story.
And that's why we haven't understood the meaning of what we've historically done.
All of the time we were playing with each other.
tensions and conflict.
It costs us work to talk about races. I think it's because we're not willing to engage in a truth and reconciliation.
In South Africa, people understood that they could not overcome <unk> racial without a truth with truth and reconciliation.
In Rwanda, even before the genocide had this commitment, but in this country we haven't done it.
I was in Germany giving talks about death.
It was fascinating because one of the teachers stood up after my presentation and said, "You know that it's okay disturbing to listen to what you can do.
<unk> "There is no death penalty in Germany.
We can never be here."
The room stayed silently and a lady said, "There's no way that with our story, we can never get into the systematic death of human beings.
It would be irrational that we <unk> and <unk> and <unk>
So let's look at this.
How would we be going to feel in a world where a nation like Germany, would be, especially if they were in their <unk>
We couldn't do it <unk>
It would be irrational.
And yet, there's this disconnection.
I think our identity is in danger.
If we don't really care about these hard issues, the positive things and wonderful things are, however, <unk>
We love innovation.
We are fascinated by technology.
We love entertainment.
But lately, those realities are <unk> by suffering, the <unk> the <unk>
In my view, you need to integrate the two things.
lately recently, we talk about the need to have more hope, more engagement, more dedication with the basic challenges of the life of this complex world.
I think that means spending more time thinking about and talking about the poor, the <unk> who never come to TED.
Think about them is, in a way, something that's inside our being.
It's true that we have to believe in issues that we haven't seen.
We are. In spite of being so rational, so <unk>
<unk> with innovation, development comes not just from brain ideas.
These things come from ideas that come from ideas also for the convictions of the heart.
This connection of the mind with the heart is what drives us to look at the bright and <unk> but also in the dark and the hard.
<unk> <unk> the great <unk> leader was talking about this.
He said, "When we were in East Europe, suffering the <unk> we wanted all sorts of things, but primarily what we needed was hope, orientation for spirit, a will to be in sites of despair and being <unk>
Well, that orientation for the spirit is pretty much on the heart of what I think, is that even in communities like TED, it needs to be.
There is no disconnect related to technology and design, that allows us to truly be humans if we don't pay their due attention to poverty, to <unk> to inequality, to injustice.
Now I want to suggest that these thoughts make up a much more challenging identity, than if we ignore these things.
We go back to <unk>
I had the big privilege, being a young lawyer to meet Rosa <unk>
These women were getting together just to speak.
Occasionally, Mrs. <unk> called me to say, <unk> comes the lady <unk> We're going to get together to speak.
Do you want to come and <unk>
I said, "Yes, lady. I do."
So she was like, "Well what are you going to do when you <unk>
I read <unk>
So I was going and just the <unk>
It was very <unk> very <unk>
And at one occasion I was there, listening to these <unk> and after a couple of hours, Mrs. Parks went to me, and he said, "Now, my <unk> tell me that this idea of justice justice.
<unk> what you're trying to do."
And I started to give it my speech.
I said, "Well, we're trying to question injustice.
We try to help those who have been blind.
We try to confront prejudice and discrimination in criminal justice.
We try to end up with the <unk> of life, without freedom for children.
We try to do something about death.
We try to reduce the population in prisons.
We try to end the <unk> <unk>
I gave all my best speech and at the end of me and he looked at me and said, "You know, <unk> <unk> <unk>
And <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
At that time, Ms. Mrs. <unk> got my finger in the face and said, "This is why you have to be very much, but very <unk>
I think actually, the TED community has to be much more <unk>
We have to find the way to address those challenges, those problems, that suffering.
Because finally humanity depends on compassion for others.
I've learned some very simple things in my work.
I've been educated in things.
I've come to understand and believe that every one of us is higher than the worst thing we have ever seen.
I think that's true for everybody on the planet.
I'm convinced that if someone says a lie. It's not because it's a liar.
I'm sure if someone takes something that doesn't belongs to you, it's not a <unk>
Even if somebody kills another, it's not a <unk>
This is why I think there's a basic dignity in the people that should be <unk> by the law.
I also believe that in many parts of this country and, surely, in many parts of the world, the opposite of poverty is not wealth.
That's what it is.
I really think that in many parts the opposite of poverty is justice.
And finally, I think that though it's very <unk> very beautiful, very <unk> very <unk> we don't really judge ourselves for our technology, because of our designs, not by our intellectual or rational.
At the end of a society, the character of a society, not because of the way they treat the powerful, powerful, <unk> but as they treat poor people -- <unk> them.
Because it's in this context as we start to understand truly profound issues about what we are.
Sometimes I feel <unk> I'm going to end with a story.
Sometimes I make a lot of force.
<unk> tired, like everyone.
Sometimes those ideas go beyond my <unk> in an important way.
I've been representing these guys who have been convicted of a lot of <unk>
I'm going to jail and I see my clients of 13 and 14 years old, who have been <unk> so that they were <unk>
And I start thinking, how can it be?
How can a judge turn to somebody who isn't it?
The judge would make it as an adult, but I see a kid.
I was very late at night, I was awake <unk> Oh God, if the judge can turn you into something you're not, you must have magical powers.
Yes, <unk> the judge has magical powers.
You should ask for some of that.
As I was too late, I couldn't think right, but I started working on a <unk>
I had a <unk> client -- a little, black poor, black.
I started working on the <unk> with a <unk> who said, <unk> for my 14-year-old black client to be treated as a classic <unk> of 75 years, CEO of a <unk>
In <unk> I put there have been <unk> conduct in the <unk> in the behavior of police and in the process.
There was a <unk> line on how in this country there is no ethical -- but a lack of ethics.
The next morning, I woke up thinking that <unk> <unk> would be a dream, or really the <unk>
For my horror, not only had had been sent to the court.
It took about two months, I had forgotten it.
And then finally <unk> Oh God, I have to go to the court for this case, stupid.
I got into the car and I was truly <unk> <unk>
I went into the court.
I thought this would be very difficult and <unk>
I finally got off the car. He walked to court.
I was going up the stairs when I met a black man who was <unk> was the <unk> of the court.
When he saw me, she came to me and said, "Who is you?"
I said, "I'm a <unk> He said, "It's you <unk> I said yes.
So I got <unk> and I was <unk>
And I was going on on the ear, actually.
He said, "I'm proud of <unk>
I have to tell you now that that was <unk>
That was connected deeply with my interior, with my identity with the ability that we all have to contribute to the community with a vision of hope.
Well, I went to the <unk>
When the judge saw me.
And he said, "Mr. Stevenson, you wrote this audacity <unk>
I said, "I know Mr. <unk> I went me." And we started going.
People started there. They were all <unk>
I was the one that had written those <unk>
They got the policemen to <unk> <unk> <unk>
Suddenly we didn't know how, the room was full of people -- all furious because we talked about races, because we talked about poverty, because we talked about inequality.
With the <unk> of the eye, I got to see the <unk> which was going and <unk>
I would look at the window and let me hear all that <unk>
<unk> walking over here and there.
Finally, this old black <unk> with a concern, walked into the room and sat behind me, almost on the lawyers.
A few minutes later, the judge would have a <unk>
During the break a <unk> I showed <unk> because the <unk> had entered the room.
The assistant ran over the old black.
And he said, <unk> what do you do in the <unk> room.
And the old black stood up and looked at the <unk> I looked at me, and he said, <unk> this room of audiences to tell this young man that keeps her view in the target with <unk>
I have come to TED today, because I think many of you understand that the moral bow of the universe is very big, but it folds into justice.
That we can't truly be able to do that, if we don't care about human rights and for dignity.
That our survival is linked to each other.
That our visions of technology, design, entertainment and creativity should be <unk> to <unk> <unk> and justice.
And above all, to those of you who share this, I just want to tell you that keep your view in the target with <unk>
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: <unk> to hear and see an obvious desire for the audience, of this community, to help in your purpose to do something.
Something that's not an check. What can we do?
<unk> There are various opportunities at close together.
If you live in the state of California, for example, there will be a <unk> this spring in which I'm going to make an effort to bring the funds that are spending today in significant policies.
For example, here in California, you're going to spend a billion dollars in death penalty in the next five years, a billion dollars.
And despite this, the <unk> of the homicide cases not <unk> in <unk>
<unk> people don't get at all.
Here's a chance of change.
This <unk> is going to propose that these funds are going to make the law, to safety.
I think there is a very close opportunity.
CA: There's been a huge declining decline in the crime in the last three decades.
Part of the explanation, it says it has to do with the biggest <unk> rate.
What would you say to you who you think it is?
<unk> Actually, the crime rate with violence has remained relatively stable.
The big growth in mass <unk> in this country is not for crimes against violence.
It's because of the wrong war.
That's why this dramatic increase in the <unk> population.
And we let us convince you for the rhetoric of that punishment.
We have three legal causes to bring people to <unk> to steal a bicycle, for small crimes against property, instead of making them <unk> those resources to their victims.
I think we need to do more to help the victims of <unk> and not less.
It seems to me that our current philosophy about punishment does nothing for anybody.
I think that's the orientation that has to change.
CA: <unk> you have excited to be <unk> today.
You're very inspiring.
Thank you very much for having come to TED. Thank you.
<unk> <unk> the threats of bin Laden.
<unk> Two: <unk> in Somalia. You send the police using the pepper gas.

Oh, my God!
Peter <unk> These are just some of the clips I got in the last six months, <unk> could be the last six days or the last six years.
The idea is that the media means <unk> negative news because our minds are paying attention.
And that responds to a very good reason.
In every second of our senses, our senses get a lot more data than probably the brain can be able to get.
And like nothing more than survive, the first stop in all of those data is an old fragment of the temporal lobe called <unk>
The amygdala is our early warning detector -- the danger.
<unk> and records all the information looking for something in the environment that could make us harm.
And so from a <unk> of stories, I was looking at the negative.
That old saying from the <unk> "If you have blood -- it's very true.
And because all digital devices give us negative news, seven days a week, 24 hours a day, no wonder that we are <unk>
It's not surprising that people think the world is going to be worse.
But maybe it isn't.
Maybe, instead, what actually happens is we get <unk>
Perhaps enormous progress done in the last century by a series of forces is <unk> so we have the potential to create a world of abundance in the next three decades.
I'm not saying that we don't have our good problems -- climate change, the scarcity of species, the shortage of water and <unk> without doubt we have.
As human beings are very good at <unk> the problems and the long time, we just have them.
<unk> then what happened in the last century to see where we go.
In the last hundred years, the average of life has been more than <unk> the average income per capita income has been <unk> across the world.
<unk> mortality has reduced 10 times.
In addition, the cost of food and electricity and communications, has fallen from 10 to 1,000 times.
Steve <unk> showed us that we are living the most peaceful time in human history.
And Charles Kenny that global literacy went from 25 to more than 80 percent in the last 130 years.
We're really living an extraordinary time.
A lot of people forget it.
And we follow <unk> and higher expectations.
And in fact, we will make meaning of poverty.
<unk> today in the United States today, a lot of the people who live under the poverty line have electricity, water, toilets, Japan, television, cell conditioning and cars.
The <unk> <unk> of the last century, the <unk> on the planet, would have ever dreamed of such <unk>
It is a lot of the technology -- and the technology is, and it is now growing up exponential growth.
My good friend Ray shows that any tool that <unk> on information technology jumps into this curve, Moore's Law, and doubling the performance of the price in about 12 to 24 months.
That's why the mobile phone you have in your pocket is a million times cheaper and a thousand times faster than a supercomputer in the '70s.
Now look at this curve.
It's Moore's Law for the last hundred years.
I want you to watch two things on this curve.
First, the soft thing is -- in good and bad times, in war and peace, in recession in depression and rise.
It's the outcome of fast computers used to build faster computers.
It doesn't stop in front of any of the great challenges.
And even though it's <unk> on a law on the left, it goes up.
The growth rate of technology is actually getting faster.
And on this curve, it goes to <unk> Moore's Law, there's a series of extraordinarily powerful technologies that we tell today.
<unk> in the cloud, which my friends of <unk> call infinite computing and networks, and the ability to democratize personalized <unk> and the ability to democratize personalized production across the planet, synthetic biology, <unk> the vaccines and our food, digital medicine, the <unk> and the A.I.
I mean, how many of you saw the victory on "Jeopardy" <unk>
It was coming.
I looked for the newspapers the best headline that I had.
And I loved this this: <unk> <unk> <unk>
"Jeopardy" isn't an easy game.
It plays the <unk> of human language.
Imagine this artificial intelligence in the cloud, available for everybody on the phone.
Four years ago, in TED, Ray Kurzweil and I, we launched a new university called <unk> <unk>
We teach these technologies to our students, and in particular, how can you use to solve the great challenges of humanity.
And every year we asked them to release a company, or a product or a service that can positively affect the lives of a billion people in a decade.
Think about that, the fact that a group of students today can impact the lives of a billion people.
Thirty years ago, that would have <unk> absurd.
Today we can point out a <unk> of companies that have already done.
When I think about creating abundance, it doesn't mean to create life <unk> for every single day, it's about creating a life of the possible.
It's about taking that stuff that is scarce and making it <unk>
You see, scarcity is <unk> and technology is a force that releases resources.
I'll give you an example.
It's a <unk> story in the <unk>
He's the guy on the left.
Would the <unk> of <unk>
The troops of <unk> ate with <unk> and the same <unk> with gold.
But the king of <unk> ate with aluminum <unk>
You see, the aluminum was the most valuable metal in the planet, was worth more than gold and <unk>
That's why the tip of the Washington <unk> is from aluminum <unk>
You see, even though aluminum is the <unk> of the Earth's mass -- it doesn't come as a pure metal as a <unk>
It's attached to oxygen and <unk>
But then he got the <unk> and made the aluminum thing so cheap that we used it as if it was <unk>
We have this analogy to the future.
Let's think about energy scarcity.
Ladies and gentlemen, we are on a planet <unk> for 5,000 times more energy than we use in a year.
They get to the Earth 16 <unk> of energy every 88 minutes.
This is not about candy, but <unk>
And there's good news.
This year, for the first time, the cost of solar power in India is 50 percent less than the generated of the generated by <unk> <unk> rupees versus 17 rupees.
The cost of solar energy fell 50 percent last year.
Last month, MIT published a study that shows that at the end of the decade, in the <unk> parts of the United States, electricity will cost six cents per hour compared to the 15 cents of the national average.
And if we have abundance of energy we also have abundance of water.
Let's talk about the wars in the water.
Do you remember when Carl Sagan pointed the spaceship to the Earth, in 1990, after I spent <unk>
<unk> a famous picture. How do you <unk>
"A <unk> <unk>
Because we live on a water planet.
We live on a planet covered in 70 percent water.
Yes, the <unk> is saltwater, two percent of it is ice, and we fought through the <unk> of the world, but there is a hope.
It's a technology that's available not 10 or 20 years, but right now.
It comes from nanotechnology, the <unk>
In a conversation with Dean Kamen this morning, one of the innovators in the <unk> I'd like to share with you, gave me permission to <unk> her technology called <unk> <unk> already the size of a small refrigerator size.
It is able to generate a thousand liters of water to the day of any source source, saltwater, water water, a <unk> for less than two cents the <unk>
President of Coke just <unk> that will make a significant test of hundreds of these units in the developing world.
If that comes out right, and I have full confidence that it will be, Coca-Cola to implement it in <unk> countries on the planet.
This is an enormous innovation that is about this technology that today.
And we've seen it in cell phones.
Oh my God, we're going to get to 70 percent penetration penetration in the developing world for the end of 2013.
<unk> that warrior <unk> has better mobile communications in the middle of Kenya that President Reagan 25 years ago.
And of counting with a smartphone with Google, it has access to more knowledge and information than President Clinton 15 years ago.
She lives in a world of abundance of information and communications that nobody could have predicted before.
better than that, the things that you and I have paid them tens and hundreds of thousands of dollars -- <unk> video books, images, libraries of books and music, <unk> technology -- now <unk> and losing market value with cell phones.
Maybe the best one is going to get when you get health applications.
Last month, I had the pleasure to announce with the Foundation, Foundation, which is the X <unk> <unk> <unk> 10 million dollars.
We are challenging the teams of the world to bring these technologies into a mobile device that comes in, and because it has <unk> they can be able to get out of the <unk>
To win it has to make better diagnostics than a certified medical team.
Imagine this device in the middle of the developing world where there are no doctors, where the <unk> charge is 25 percent and there are <unk> of health workers.
When this device is <unk> a virus of RNA or DNA that wouldn't be able to call the health of the health and, first of all, prevent the pandemic.
But this is the biggest force of producing a world of abundance.
I call it the <unk>
The white lines here are the population.
We just went through the brand of seven billion.
By the way, the best protection against the demographic explosion is to give the world of education and health.
In 2010, we had less than two billion people online, connected.
By 2020, it will go from two billion to five billion people on the Internet.
Three billion minds never before they add to global conversation.
What are these people?
What do you do? What is it <unk>
And instead of a economic collapse we will have the biggest injection of the story.
These people represent tens of billions of dollars in the global economy.
And <unk> of more health thanks to the <unk> of a better education education and because of using 3D impressions and computation in the cloud will be more productive than ever before.
What can us bring us three more members of human humanity, healthy ones and <unk>
What about some voices never before <unk>
What if we give the <unk> wherever they are, a voice to be <unk> and be able to act for the first time?
What do you do -- these three million?
And if you're the contributions we can't afford to.
One thing that I learned with the X X is that small teams guided by her passion with one of of course, they can do things that were <unk> things that could only make the big corporations and governments.
I'm going to end up sharing a story that really excites me.
There's a program that maybe some of you know.
It's called <unk>
<unk> at the University of Washington in Seattle.
It's a game where people can take a sequence of amino acids, and figure out how to fold the protein.
The folds determine the structure and the functionality.
It's a very important thing in research research.
And so far, it was a problem of <unk>
They've played with this university professors in each other.
Then hundreds of thousands of people went together and started <unk>
And it has been shown that the recognition machinery of human patterns is better folding proteins than the best computers.
Ladies and gentlemen, what gives me a huge confidence in the future is that we have more power to take the great challenges of the planet.
We have the tools with this exponential technology.
We have the passion of <unk>
We have the capital of <unk>
And we have three billion minds that we are going to get together to work on the solution of the big challenges and do what we should do.
We have for a few decades extraordinary.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about a very controversial idea.
<unk> <unk>
And as the idea can be explained in a minute, before I give you three examples to do time.
The first story is Charles Darwin, one of my heroes.
He was here, as you know, in <unk>
Maybe they believed that <unk> <unk> but it wasn't like that.
It actually <unk> fish.
And he described one of them as a very <unk>
It was the <unk>
It was a lot to the <unk>
Now the fish is in the Red Cross of <unk>
But we've heard this story a lot of times, about Galapagos and other places, so that has nothing special.
But the case is that we still come in the Galapagos.
We still think they're <unk>
<unk> still say they're still <unk>
So what happens here?
The second story, it also illustrates another concept.
Because I was there in <unk> studying a lagoon in West Africa.
I was there because I grew up in Europe and then I wanted to work in Africa.
I thought it could be <unk>
I was burned in the sun, and I was convinced that I was not there.
This is my first exhibition in the sun.
The lagoon was surrounded by <unk> and as you can see, from some mangroves.
There were <unk> of about 20 <unk> the black <unk>
And the fishery of this <unk> was very abundant and spent for a good moment, so I became more than half the average in Ghana.
When I went there 27 years later the amount of fish had dropped in half.
I went to the five inches.
It was a genetic pressure.
There was still fish.
In a way, they were still happy.
And the fish are still happy to be there.
I mean, nothing to changed, but everything has changed.
My third story is that I was <unk> in the introduction of <unk> fishing in Southeast Asia.
In the 1950s, <unk> started in <unk> Europe did a lot of development projects.
The fishing development was to impose the countries that had 100,000 <unk> <unk> industrial fishing.
And this little boat, quite <unk> called <unk> four.
And I went out to fish in it, and we did study in the south of the Sea, China <unk> and, above all, in the Sargasso Sea.
What we captured was something <unk>
I know now, the bottom of the sea.
Ninety percent of what we captured was <unk> other animals that are at the bottom.
And most of the fish are tiny blobs of <unk> about <unk> that are <unk> fish.
In short, the sea bottom came to the deck and then it was <unk>
These images are extraordinary because the transition is very fast.
In one year, you do a study and then start commercial fishing.
The bottom of being a solid background, in this case, to be a <unk>
This is a dead <unk>
Not <unk> <unk> because they were dead.
Once we captured a alive.
I was still not <unk>
And so they wanted to <unk> because it was a good food.
This mountain of remains is what they collected fishermen every time they go to an area where they have never fish.
But it's not <unk>
We don't remember it.
They took the start to start at a new level, without remembering what was there.
If you look at this something like this.
On the axis, we have things that are <unk> biodiversity, number of <unk> the <unk> of the country, the water supply.
And that changes over time. It changes because people do things with <unk>
Every generation is using images to the beginning of their conscious life as normal as the normal and they extrapolate forward.
The difference is they perceive loss of loss.
But they don't perceive the loss that happened before.
You can look at the <unk>
And at the end of the end of the <unk>
And that, in large measure, we want to do it now.
We want to keep things that they are no longer -- or not what they were.
But you should think that this problem affects people when societies are killing animals without knowing what they've done to about generations later.
Because obviously, an animal that's very prevalent before <unk> is <unk>
You don't lose animals.
You lose each other animals.
Even if this isn't perceived as a great loss.
Over time, we focus on big animals, and in a synonymous sea of large fish.
They become <unk> because the <unk>
Over time there are just a few fish, but we think that's the point of <unk>
And the question is, why do we accept this?
Well, because we don't know it was different.
In fact, a lot of people, scientists, <unk> that was very different.
And they will do it because the evidence presented in a previous way, is not the way they would expect the evidence.
For example, the anecdote that some of you today, as a captain of such a captain of the fish can be used in this area cannot be used or usually they don't use the scientists of the fishery, because it's not <unk>
So we have a situation where people don't know the past, even though we live in <unk> societies because they don't trust the sources of the past.
From there the huge role that can be able to fulfill a protected marine area.
Because with marine protected areas, we actually recreated the past.
<unk> the past that people can't conceive of because the starting point has been run and is extremely low.
That's for the people that you can see a protected marine area and they can benefit from the vision that <unk> which allow them to erase their point of <unk>
And what about the people who can't do it because they don't have access, like the people in the West -- for example?
I think that the arts and cinema may fill in the vacuum. The simulation.
This is a simulation of the Bay Bay.
A long time ago, there were gray whales in the Bay bay 500 years ago.
And you may have noticed that the <unk> and <unk> are like <unk>
And if you think about <unk> if you think about why people were moved with the movie <unk> to talk about the story of <unk> why did we do with the <unk>
Because it raises something that, in a sense, has been lost.
And so my <unk> the only one to give, is to <unk> <unk> <unk> underwater.
Thank you very much.
Hi. I'm Kevin <unk> the <unk> <unk> manager and I look at YouTube videos in a professional way.
It's true.
So we're going to see today why the videos are making viral and what importance does that.
We all want to be <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> When I was younger, that seemed very, very difficult.
But now video video makes any of us, or our actions, copper in a part of our global culture.
Anyone can be made famous on the Internet in a <unk>
They go up over 48 hours of video to YouTube for minute.
And of those, only one small percentage is made viral gets infinite <unk> and wins cultural <unk>
How does that happen?
Three things: creators of trends, and surprise.
Well, <unk>
<unk> <unk> Oh my God, my God.
Oh my God!
Wow.
<unk> <unk>
KA: Last year, <unk> <unk> published this video filmed outside of his home in the National Park.
In 2010, it was 23 million times.
This graph shows the views in the popular rise last summer.
<unk> was not saying to make a viral video.
I just wanted to share a double rainbow <unk>
That's what you do if you're called <unk> Mountain <unk>
There were already published many videos of nature.
This video was published in January.
So what happened here?
It was Jimmy <unk>
Jimmy <unk> published this question that I went to the <unk>
The creators of trends like Jimmy <unk> present new and interesting things and <unk> to a wider audience.
Rebecca <unk>  It's Friday, Friday. You have to start the Friday.   Everybody wants to get a weekend  --  -- <unk> Friday. <unk> on a Friday.  KA: Don't think that we can have this conversation without talking about this video, I hope.
<unk> of Rebecca <unk> one of the most popular videos of the year.
You saw it almost 200 million times this year.
This graph shows the frequency of use.
And just like <unk> <unk> this video seemed to be came from nothing.
So what happened this day?
Well, it was Friday, it's true.
And if you ask those other <unk> they're also a Friday.
But what happened this day in particular <unk>
Well, I took it <unk> and many blogs started writing about it.
Michael J. <unk> <unk> Science -- was one of the first people to make a joke on Twitter.
But the important thing is that a person or a group of creators of trends are taking on a view and share it with a broad audience, accelerating the process.
So this community of people who share this big joke in the internal joke then starts to talk about that and do things.
And now there are 10,000 <unk> <unk> on YouTube.
So only in the first seven days, there was a parody for each of the other days.
Unlike the <unk> entertainment of the 20th century, this community participation is our way of being part of the phenomenon -- or doing something new with <unk>
<unk> <unk> is an inorganic animation with a <unk> music.
So that's it.
This year they saw about 50 million times.
And if you think that's rare, you know that there's a version of three hours that has been seen four million times.
Until cats saw this video.
And there are cats who saw other cats to see the video.
But what's important here is creativity that woke up between the Internet <unk> community.
There was <unk>
Somebody did an ancient version.
And then it became international did.
All of a sudden, it came up a whole community of remixes that made this happen to be a stupid joke to something that we can all form in a part.
Because today not just <unk> <unk>
Who might have predicted something like this?
Who could have predicted <unk> <unk> or Rebecca <unk> or Rebecca <unk>
What script could you have written in this situation?
In a world that you go up two days of video for minute, only that only one and unexpected can make it out the way these things have done.
When a friend told me that I had to see this big video of a guy who protest against the <unk> in New York, I admit that I didn't really get interested in it.
Casey <unk> I was not <unk> by not circular by <unk> but often there are obstacles that can prevent you circular circular by <unk>
KA: Thank you to the surprise and his humor, Casey <unk> made that five million saw and understand their idea.
So this approach is worth the whole new approach to the whole new way.
And all of this is leading to a great <unk>
<unk> <unk> What does this mean?
<unk>
KA: What does this mean?
The creators of trend, creative communities of participation, all unexpected, are features of a new kind of media kind of culture, which we all have access and is the audience that defines the <unk>
As I said before, one of the celebrity celebrities of the world, Justin <unk> started on YouTube.
Don't borrow permission to express your ideas.
Now we're all a little owner of our pop culture.
These are not the characteristics of the old media -- it's just the current media -- but we have the entertainment of the future.
Thank you.
This is not a <unk> story.
It's a puzzle that's still <unk>
Let me tell you about some of the pieces.
Imagine the first <unk> a man burning the work of a whole life.
It's a poet, a <unk> a man whose entire life had been supported by the single hope of unit and freedom of their country.
<unk> as the <unk> come into <unk> facing the fact that their life had been totally in no avail.
The words, for so much friends, I can now do it.
It was <unk> in silence.
He died in history.
He's my grandfather.
I never met it.
But our lives are much more than our memories.
My grandmother never allowed me to forget his story.
My task was not to let that been in <unk> and my lesson was to learn that the story tried to try and get it out, but I would take it out.
The next part of the puzzle is about a boat to the dawn <unk> turn into the sea.
My mother, <unk> had only 18 years old when her father died, and a <unk> marriage and two little girl.
For her, life had been destined for a <unk> <unk> escape.
It was inconceivable for her that I couldn't do that.
And then from a <unk> <unk> that defies fiction, a boat sat down to the sea dressed <unk>
Every adults knew the risks.
The greatest fear was the apes, the rape and death.
Like most adults, my mother was wearing a <unk> with poison.
If we were asked first to take it first of my sister and I, and then she and my grandmother.
My first memories are from that boat, the steady rate of the engine, the <unk> diving into each <unk> and the vast and empty horizon.
I don't remember hackers who came several times, but they were <unk> with the bravery of men in our boat, or the engine dying and not being able to move for six hours.
But I can remember the lights on the platform in front of the coast of Malaysia, and to the young man who collapsed and died, and he died, he was just too much to get it, and the first apple that I tried to put out of the men from the platform.
No apple had the same flavor.
After three months in a refugee camp, <unk> in <unk>
And the next piece of the puzzle is about four women across three generations making a new life together.
We set up in <unk> a suburb of <unk> class whose population is comprised of immigration.
Unlike the middle class suburbs whose existence I <unk> in <unk> there was no sense of the right.
The smells that came from the stores were the rest of the world.
And the fragments of English English were <unk> between people who had one thing in common: they were starting again.
My mother worked in farms, then in a car line, working six days, double turn.
Even so, I found time to study English and get a <unk> <unk> of <unk>
We were poor.
All of the dollars were <unk> and that <unk> extra <unk> in English and mathematics, wouldn't mind what was supposed to be, which was usually <unk> and it was always second hand.
Two pairs in school, one to hide the holes in the other.
A school uniform to the <unk> because I had to last six years.
And I had <unk> <unk> and <unk> about the <unk> <unk> and some <unk> went back back to home."
And home, where?
Something in me is <unk>
I was accumulating determination and a voice that said, "I'm going to <unk>
My mother, my sister and I was sitting in the same bed.
My mother was <unk> every night, but we ran back on our day and I was telling the movements of our grandmother at home.
My mother had <unk> all of the ship.
And my task was to be wakes up until his nightmares was starting to be able to do it.
She opened a computer shop, then I studied to be <unk> and opened another business.
And women were coming with their stories about men who couldn't do the mad <unk> angry and <unk> and <unk> boys in between two worlds.
And they looked <unk>
and they were created centers.
I lived in parallel.
In one, it was a classic <unk> relentless with what I <unk> from myself.
On the other, I was <unk> in <unk> lives -- increasingly, <unk> for violence, drug abuse and isolation.
But many of them got help over the years.
And for that work, when I was studying my last year of lawyers, my young Australian young Australian young year.
And I was <unk> from one piece of the puzzle to the other, but its edges didn't go away.
So <unk> resident <unk> <unk> was now as <unk> refugee and social activist invited to talk about sites that I had never heard of, and in houses whose existence would ever have imagined.
I didn't know the <unk>
I didn't know how to use <unk>
I didn't know how to talk about wine.
I didn't know how to talk about anything.
I wanted to retreat into the <unk> and the comfort of life in a suburb <unk> -- a mother, a mother and two daughters finishing the day as they did for almost 20 years, <unk> on the day of each and <unk> <unk> the three still in the same bed.
And I told my mom that I couldn't do it.
It reminded me that I had now the same age that she had when we went to the ship.
He wasn't a choice.
He said, "What don't you be <unk>
So I talked about <unk> <unk> and education and <unk> to the marginalized and the <unk>
And the more frankly I was talking about was <unk> to speak.
I met people from all the roads in life, many of them doing what they were going to do, living on the border of the possible.
And although I ended up my <unk> I realized I couldn't stay in a lawyer.
There had to be another piece of the puzzle.
And I realized at the same time that it's okay to be a stranger, just a <unk> new one in the scene -- and not only is it something that is being grateful, maybe a gift of the ship.
Because being inside it can easily mean <unk> the <unk> can easily mean accepting the assumptions of your <unk>
And I gave enough steps out of my comfort zone to know that, yes, the world <unk> but not the way we fear it.
<unk> they wouldn't have been <unk> they were <unk>
There was an energy there, an optimism <unk> a blend of humility and <unk>
So I kept my intuition.
They brought to a small group of people for whom the motto cannot <unk> it was a powerful challenge.
For a year we didn't have a <unk>
At the end of every day, I was making a giant bottle of soup that all <unk>
They would go back to the night.
Most of our ideas were crazy, but some bright ones, and we opened up.
I made the decision to move to the U.S.
After a single journey.
My <unk>
Three months later, I had <unk> and the adventure <unk>
Before <unk> let me tell you about my grandmother.
She grew up in a time where the <unk> was the social norm and the local <unk> was the person who cared.
Life didn't have changed for centuries.
His father died shortly after she was born.
The mother grew up.
At 17 became a <unk> of a <unk> whose mother <unk>
No support of his husband, caused an <unk> to <unk> and take the cause, and much more <unk> caused when I won.
He can't do it proved to be wrong.
I was in the shower in a hotel room in Sydney when she died, after 1,000 miles in <unk>
I looked through the <unk> of the shower and saw him standing on the other side.
I knew I'd come to <unk>
My mother called minutes later.
Days later, we went to a Buddhist temple in <unk> and we sat around his <unk>
We tell them, and we made sure we were still with it.
At night a monk came and told us he had to close the <unk>
My mother asked us to hold his hand.
I asked the <unk> "Why his hand is hot, and the rest of the body so <unk>
"Because you've taken his hand from the <unk> he said.
"Don't have it <unk>
If there's a nerve in our family, that runs through women.
Since those of us were and how life we built and we can now see that the men who have reached our lives would have been <unk>
The defeat would have been very easily.
Now I want to have my own kids, and I wonder about the ship.
Who could wish that for you?
However, I'm afraid to the privilege of the easy, right.
Can I give you a <unk> in your lives, a brave brave of each <unk> the <unk> rhythm of the engine, the vast horizon that doesn't guarantee nothing?
I don't know.
But if I could take it and see them and you would do it.
<unk> <unk> and also the mother of this is here today, in the fourth or fifth row.
My story starts in <unk> about two years ago.
I was in the desert, under the <unk> sky with the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
We were having a conversation about how nothing has changed from the time of ancient <unk> the <unk>
In those days when the Indians wanted to travel <unk> to a car and put the sky.
Now we do it with airplanes.
In that time when I <unk> the great Prince warrior Indian warrior and pull out a bow and with a <unk> on the ground, she got water.
Now we do the same with <unk> and machines.
The conclusion that we took was that the machinery had replaced the magic.
And that was a lot of me.
Every time I felt a little bit more <unk>
I was given this idea of losing the ability to lose the ability to enjoy and appreciate a sunset if I didn't get the camera, if I couldn't get my friends.
I thought the technology had to allow magic to not kill her.
As a child, my grandfather gave me his <unk> silver <unk>
And this piece of 50 years was for me to my most magical thing.
It became a golden door towards a world full of images, and <unk> and <unk> in my imagination.
I had the feeling that the mobile clocks -- the luxury clocks and the cameras prevent them from <unk>
<unk> our inspiration.
And so I was struck by this kind of technological world to see how to use it to create magic, instead of killing me.
<unk> books from 16 years.
So when I saw the iPad, I saw a narrative device able to connect readers from the entire world.
You can know how to take the book, you know?
Where we are, where we are.
They bring the text off with the image, visual animation, sound and touch.
<unk> becomes more and more <unk>
But what do we do for that?
I'm about to launch an interactive application for iPad.
It says, <unk> your fingers on every light."
And so --  He says, "This box belongs <unk> I write my name.
And so I got a character from the book.
In several times, I get a <unk> -- the iPad knows where I live through GPS -- that comes to me.
My inner girl is excited about all of these possibilities.
I've talked a lot about magic.
And I don't mean <unk> and <unk> but to that magic of childhood, to those ideas that we <unk> of children.
For some reason, fireflies in a jar were always <unk>
So over here, we have to tilt the iPad, to release fireflies.
And really, they light up your way in what subtraction of the book.
Another idea that I was fascinated by as a girl was that a whole galaxy in a <unk>
So here, every book and every single world becomes a <unk> that I <unk> into this magic device within the device.
And this opens up a map.
In every book of fantasy I've always been maps but have been static maps.
This is a map that grows, <unk> and guide you during the rest of the book.
In certain points of the book also <unk>
Now I'm going to go in.
Another extremely important aspect for me is to create Indian content and contemporary content.
These are the <unk>
We've all heard of fairies and <unk> but how many people outside India know their <unk> <unk>
These poor <unk> have been trapped in the cameras of Indra for millennia, in an old and <unk> book.
That's why we are bringing them back into a childhood story.
In a story that deals today like the environmental crisis.
And talking about the environmental crisis, one of the problems in the last 10 years has been that kids have been <unk> glued to their <unk> not to the outside world.
But now with mobile technology, we can get our kids to the natural world with their technology.
One of the interactions of the book is this adventure that you have to go outside the outside, take the camera or the iPad, and collect images of different natural objects.
As a child, I had a lot of <unk> stones, stones, <unk> and <unk>
For some reason kids don't do it.
So to get this ritual of childhood that you have to go out and on a chapter -- it would take a picture to a flower and then <unk>
On another chapter, you have to take a picture of a piece of cortex and then <unk>
So this is a <unk> digital collection that then can be put on the Web.
A child in London puts a picture of a <unk> and he says, "Oh, today, I saw a <unk>
A boy in India says, "I saw a <unk>
And it creates this kind of social network around a collection of digital pictures that have been taking.
Inside the variants of connection between magic, Earth and technology are so many possibilities.
In the next book we asked to have an interaction where you come out with the iPad and the video on and by augmented reality, you see a group of <unk> <unk> that appear on the inner plants of the house.
On a moment the screen is full of leaves as well.
And you have to do the sound of the wind and <unk> to be able to read the rest of the book.
We're going to a world where the forces of nature are embedded with technology and magic and technology and technology are coming to each other.
It <unk> the power of the sun.
We're approaching our children and ourselves to the natural world and to that magic, joy and child love that we sit through with a simple story.
Thank you.
I'd like to talk to you about why many projects of <unk> <unk>
And I think, really, that the most important thing is that we stop listening to patients.
And one of the things we did at <unk> University was <unk> to a director of listening.
And not in a very scientific way, she raised a little coffee cup or tea and asked patients, family and <unk> What <unk>
"How can we <unk>
And we tend to think that this is one of the biggest problems for what all of us, or perhaps not everyone, but most of the projects of <unk> they fail to be heard.
This is my Wi-Fi scale -- it's very simple.
It has a <unk> and it has a <unk>
Every morning I was <unk>
And yes, I have a challenge as you can see.
I got the challenge to get to 95 percent.
But it's so simple, that every time I <unk> sends my information to Google <unk>
And my doctor of <unk> has access to him too. And so he can see what my weight problem is not at the same time when I need assistance assistance or some urgency to that style -- but to see it backwards.
But there's another thing.
Like some of you you know, I have more than 4,000 followers on Twitter.
So every morning I connect to my Wi-Fi scale and before you go up to my car, people start to <unk> <unk> today I think you need a light lunch.
That's the best thing that can happen, because it's pressure of the pairs used to help patients, because it could be used for obesity, and also for patients to leave smoking.
On the other hand, it can be <unk> to move people out of their chairs and together develop some <unk> activity to have more control of their health.
From the next week.
This little <unk> connected to an iPhone or another device.
And people would go from their homes, they will take their blood pressure, <unk> their doctor, and share it with others, for example, for 100 dollars.
This is the point where patients take a position, turn back control and be captains of their own <unk> but it can also help us care about health care because of the challenges we face, as the firing of the costs of attention, the <unk> of demand and other issues.
<unk> techniques that are simple to use and start with this to engage patients in the team.
And you can do it with techniques like these, but also by <unk>
And one of the things we did want to share with you with a video with you.
We all have on shipping <unk>
Maybe we even have our cell phones.
We know perfectly where the ATM machines are in <unk>
Where are all the <unk>
And of course, we can find different chains of fast food.
But where is the closest <unk> in order to help this patient?
We asked but no one <unk>
Nobody knew where to get the <unk> saves lives at this point.
So what we did was do <unk> in the Netherlands.
We created a website, and we asked the audience to <unk> you see a <unk> please say, <unk> where, and when it's open, because sometimes you open up in <unk> and other people are closed.
And over 10,000 <unk> they were introduced in the Netherlands.
The next step was to look for the app for that.
And we did an application for the iPad.
We created an application for <unk> reality to find these <unk>
And every time you're in the city of <unk> and someone <unk> you can use your iPhone, and the next few weeks to use their cell phone from Microsoft to find the nearest <unk> which can save lives.
And from today, I'd like to present this one, not just as <unk> <unk> which is the name of the product, but also as <unk>
And we want to look at the world level.
We are <unk> all of the colleagues in the world, at other universities, to help us find, work and act like a center for the <unk> of <unk> throughout the world.
Every time you're on vacation and someone -- it can be a relative or somebody in front of you, you can find it.
I also want to invite companies around the world that could help us validate these <unk>
You could be <unk> or <unk> people for example, to see if the <unk> that shows is still in its place.
Please focus on this and not just improve health, but take control of it.
Thank you very much.
I'm here to share <unk> photograph.
Or is it <unk> <unk>
Because, of course, they're photographs that can't take off with their cameras.
My interest in photography was woke up with my first digital camera at 15 years.
I mixed with my previous passion before, but it was a little bit different because when I used the camera the process was in planning.
And when you take a photograph with a camera the process ends when the <unk>
For me photography had more to do with being in the right place, at the right time.
It seemed that anyone could do it.
So I wanted to create something different, a process that I would start to press the <unk>
<unk> like this: a building on a very <unk> road.
But it has an unexpected turn.
And despite it, it keeps a level of <unk>
Or pictures like <unk> dark and colorful as the common goal of keeping the level of <unk>
And when I say <unk> I say <unk>
Because, of course, it's not something that I can <unk> but I always want to have been captured in some way as photograph.
<unk> where you will have to think about a moment to discover the trick.
It's more to do with capturing an idea that with capturing a moment.
But what is the trick that makes it real.
They're the details or the <unk>
<unk> my light?
What is the <unk>
Sometimes the illusion is perspective.
But at the end, it's about our way to interpret the world and how you can perceive it on a <unk> surface.
It's actually not about whether it's realistic but what we think is <unk>
So I think the foundations are very simple.
I see it as a puzzle of reality in which we take different pieces of reality and put them together to create an alternative reality.
Let me show you a simple example.
Here we have three perfectly <unk> objects that we all can relate to the three-dimensional world.
But combined in a way you can create something that still looks like <unk> as if there was there.
But at the same time, we know it doesn't exist.
So, let's go into the brain because the brain doesn't embrace the fact that it doesn't really make sense.
And I see the same process by combining the pictures.
It's really going to combine different realities.
And the things that make a picture seem realistic and I think they're those in those that don't even understand the things around us in our daily lives.
But by combining photographs is very important to <unk> because otherwise something is going to be wrong.
So I would like to say there are three simple rules that are going to continue some realistic results.
As you can see, these images are not very special.
But <unk> can create something like this.
So the first rule is that the combination of pictures must have the same perspective.
Secondly, the <unk> photos must have the same kind of light.
And these two pictures played with these <unk> were taken to the same height and with the same kind of light.
The third point is to make it impossible to distinguish the beginning and the end of different images with perfect <unk>
It has to be impossible to see where the image.
This is another example.
You might think this is the image of a landscape and the bottom is <unk>
But this image is totally composed of photographs of different places.
I think it's easier to create a place that you find out because you don't need to put in danger the ideas that have in your head.
But it requires a lot of planning.
And as I thought this idea in winter knew that I had several months to try to find the different locations for the puzzle pieces of the puzzle.
For example, the fish was captured on a fishing trip.
The shores are a different location.
The <unk> part was captured in a pit of stone.
And yes, I even made the house at the top of the island for more <unk>
So to make a result of a realistic result of planning.
It always starts with a <unk> an idea.
Then you have to combine the different pictures.
And here every piece is very well <unk>
If you do a good job when you take the pictures the result can be very beautiful and then very <unk>
All the tools are there and the only threshold is our imagination.
Thank you.
I'm going to start showing a slide about technology, very boring.
Please if you can <unk>
It's a diagram I took from a portfolio of mine.
I'm not really interested in showing you the details -- but the general side.
It's about an analysis that we were doing about the power of <unk> <unk> versus the power of local area.
What's interesting about this is that this one, as many other we tend to see, is a kind of a straight line on a scale scale.
In other words, every step here represents a order of magnitude on the scale of performance.
I'm going to talk about technology with <unk> curves.
Here's a strange thing.
And that's what I'm going to talk about.
Please light the lights.
<unk> more intensity because writing about paper.
Why are we going to have technological curves at <unk> scales.
The answer is that if you draw it into a normal curve where, say, these are the years, or some unit of time, and this would be any measure of the technology that I'd like to <unk> the diagram would look ridiculous.
It would be something like this.
It doesn't say a lot.
But if you put it up for example, some other technology, like transport, on a <unk> curve, it would be very dumb, we would see a straight line.
But if something like this, it gives you a <unk> change.
If the technology of transport is as fast as <unk> last morning we could take a taxi and be in Tokyo in 30 seconds.
But it doesn't go back to that rhythm.
There are no precedent in the history of technological development of a <unk> growth that every few years advance orders of magnitude.
The question I want to make is -- look at these curves. <unk> we see that it's not going forever.
It's not possible to hold this change as fast as it goes.
It was one of two things.
Or it's going to become a typical curve like this until it comes to something completely different, or maybe I'll do something like that.
That's all that can happen.
I'm optimistic, so I think maybe something like this.
So now we would be in the middle of a transition.
In this line, we are in a transition from what the world used to be the world, to a new form.
So what I'm trying to ask, is that what the new way that the world?
What new state is the world?
The transition seems very, very confused if we are immersed in it.
I remember the future was happening in 2000 and people used to talk about what would happen in the year 2000.
This is a conference where people talk about the future and we see that the future is still 2000.
That's all we see.
In other words, the future has spent year after year, throughout my life.
But I think it's because we feel something that's going on.
And that happens a transformation. We can feel it.
And we know that it doesn't have a lot of sense to think about 30 or 50 years because everything is so different to extrapolate what we're doing today does not make any sense.
So I want to talk to you about how it might be, how could that transition to <unk>
But to do that will have to talk a little bit about things that don't have much to do with technology and computer technology.
Because I think the only way to understand is taking distance and look at things in the long term.
The scale of time I would like to do that is the time of life on Earth.
I think this image makes sense if we look at each one billion years.
So we go back about two billion years when the Earth was a huge <unk> rock with lots of chemicals that are going around them.
If we look at the way that those chemicals <unk> we give us an idea of how things happened.
And I think there are theories to start understanding the origin of RNA. I'm going to tell you a simple version of this, and that is that, at that time, there was floating around with all kinds of oil with all kinds of chemical prescriptions inside it.
Some of those oil drops a particular combination of chemicals that made them incorporate materials from the outside and the drops of drops grew up growing up.
And they began to divide.
In a sense, those were the most <unk> cell forms -- those <unk> of oil.
But those drops weren't alive, in the current sense, because each of them contained a random recipe for chemicals.
And every time you get <unk> it would be a chemical distribution of the chemicals that we <unk>
So every <unk> was a little bit different.
In fact, the drops that somehow became better at the time to incorporate chemical chemicals -- they grew more chemicals and <unk> more.
They usually lived longer, they were more <unk>
It was a form of life, life -- very simple, but things got interesting things when these drops learned the trick of abstraction.
In some way that we don't really understand these <unk> they learned to store information.
They learned to keep the information, which was the recipe for the cell, in a special chemistry called DNA.
In other words, <unk> in this <unk> evolution, a writing system that allowed them to register what they were to be able to do to <unk>
The amazing thing is that that writing system seems to have remained stable since it evolved two billion years ago.
Our recipe, our genes, they have exactly the same code, that writing system.
In fact, every living is expressed with exactly the same set of letters and the same code.
And one of the things I did just by <unk> Now we can write things with this code.
Here I have 100 <unk> of white dust that I try to hide the security people.
But <unk> took this <unk> The code has the common letters that we used to use on this -- and I wrote my personal data on this piece of DNA and <unk> 10 to the 22 times.
So if somebody wants 100 million copies of my personal card copies I have many for every person in the world and it's here.
If it was a <unk> I would have put it in a virus and would have taken it through the room.
What was the next <unk>
Writing DNA was an interesting step.
This made these cells become happy another billion years.
But then another big step happened in which things became very different, and it was that these cells started trading and communicating information forming that cell communities.
I don't know if you know, but bacteria can exchange DNA.
So for example, for example, it evolved to antibiotic resistance.
Some bacteria found a way to avoid penicillin and the <unk> to create their little DNA with other bacteria and now there are many resistant to penicillin, because bacteria communicate.
This communication gave rise to communities that, in a way, they were together in it, and found a <unk>
So <unk> or <unk> them together, or if a community was very successful all the individuals in that community getting more and more <unk> by evolution.
And the inflection point happened when these communities came to close so much that, in fact, they came together and decided to write all the recipe for the community board in a chain of DNA.
The next stage for life took another billion years.
And at that stage, we have communities developed communities from many different types of cells working together as a single organism.
In fact, we are a <unk> community.
We have many cells that don't act alone.
The skin cell is no longer for the heart, or the power of the brain, and so on.
So these communities evolved and produced more interesting levels that cell phone, which we call a organism.
The next level happened within these communities.
And these started <unk>
And to build very special structures that didn't make more than process information in community.
These are the neural structures.
The neurons are the appliances that process the information that those cell cell communities are.
In fact, they started <unk> within the community being the responsible structures of <unk> to understand and transmit information.
Those were brains and the nervous system of those communities.
And that gave them an evolutionary advantage.
Because at that time as <unk> learning was confined to the length of an organism, and not the period of evolutionary time.
So an organism, for example, learning how to eat a bit of fruit because I knew bad, and she was sick the last time he had.
That could happen during the life of an organism because they had built these data processing structures that by evolution would have learned for hundreds of thousands of years by the death of individuals who ate that fruit of it.
So the fact that the nervous system built out those <unk> structures that really accelerated the evolutionary process.
Because evolution could now happen to an individual.
It could happen in time to learn.
But then, of course, the individuals discovered the communication.
So for example, the most <unk> version we know is human language.
If we think about it, it's an amazing invention.
I have a very complicated idea of an idea that was in your head.
I'm here sitting here emitting <unk> and hopefully building a similar idea, vague and <unk> in their heads that saved some analogy with mine.
But we took something very complicated -- we made it sound like sound sequences -- and we produce something very complicated in another brain.
That allows us to start to work as a organism.
In fact, as humanity, we've started doing abstractions.
Now we go through periods similar to the similar <unk> organisms, and our <unk> methods and information processing.
For example, the invention of language was a little step in that direction.
The <unk> computer <unk> the <unk> and so on, are the specialized mechanisms that we now build to handle that information.
And that brings us together in something much bigger and faster and able to evolve more than we do before.
Now evolution can happen in <unk>
You saw the evolutionary <unk> of <unk> in which it produced some evolution with the <unk> program in front of our eyes.
And now we've accelerated time scales again.
The first stages of history that told them took us a billion years each.
The next few stages, the nervous system and the brain, took a few hundred million years.
And the other -- the language and so on, take less than a million years.
And the others -- as electronics, seems to take just a few decades.
The process is <unk> I guess it's the right word to name something that accelerates its own pace of change.
The more it does it faster it does.
And I think that's what we see in this explosion of the curve.
We see the process <unk>
But I make my life designing computers and I know that the mechanisms that work for <unk> wouldn't be possible without the recent medical advances.
But now design objects of such complexity that would be impossible for me to <unk> in a conventional way.
I don't know that every transistor in that machine machine.
There are billions of millions.
Instead, with the designers of <unk> <unk> we think of a level of abstraction, we put it in the machine and the machine with that does something that I could not do before, it gets far further and faster than ever before.
In fact, sometimes it uses methods that we don't even understand.
A particularly interesting method I've been using recently, is evolution itself.
We put into the machine an evolutionary process that operates on the scale of the <unk>
And for example, in the most extreme cases, we can evolve a program from a random sequence of instructions.
We say, "Please computer, you can run a hundred million instructions to chance?
You could run these kinds of instructions at random, running all of those programs, and take those of the ones that are <unk> to what we want to do?"
In other words, I define what I want.
Let's say I want to give you numbers, to put a simple example.
So we find the programs that are more likely to order numbers.
Of course, it's unlikely to be a random random random sequences.
But one luckily, it could get two numbers in the right order.
And I said, <unk> you could take 10 percent of those random sequences.
And I would take those and go back to the rest.
And now <unk> the ones that best ordered the numbers.
And let's go back to <unk> following a process of <unk> analog to <unk>
Let's take two programs, which is <unk> children, who are <unk> <unk> and the children will bring the properties of both programs.
So we got a new generation of programs that had a little bit more success.
And we say, "Please repeat the <unk>
Let's go back again.
They were going to take some mutations together.
And it tries again and <unk> with another generation.
Well, every generation takes a few milliseconds.
So I can do the equivalent of millions of years of evolution in a few minutes, or in complicated cases, in a few hours.
In the end, we end up with programs that we record numbers of absolutely perfect.
In fact, they are much more efficient programs than I could have written by hand.
If I look at those programs I can't tell you how they work.
I've tried to analyze them to see how they work.
These are black <unk>
But do the <unk>
In fact, I know that I have the safety of the goal because they come from a lineage of hundreds of thousands of programs that they did it.
In fact, their lives are dependent on it.
Once I was in a 747 with <unk> <unk> and he pulled out a card and says, "Look at this.
He says, "You know, plane has hundreds of thousands of <unk> who work together to offer a <unk> flight.
We know that engineering processes don't work very well when they get complicated.
So we started to depend on computers to make different design processes.
And that allows us to produce much more complex things than the normal engineering does.
But we don't understand all the choices that there are.
In that sense, it's in front of us.
We now use those programs to make computers much faster and so that we can run these programs much more quickly.
I mean, it's <unk>
The thing goes faster and faster and so I think it seems so <unk>
Because all of these technologies are <unk>
We're <unk>
And we are at an analog moment, when they became <unk>
We are <unk> and we can't understand what the hell we're creating.
We're at the tipping point.
But I think something comes behind us.
I think it would be very arrogant of our thinking that we are the end of evolution.
And I think all of us are part of the creation of whatever it comes in.
But now comes the lunch and I think I'm going to stop here before I get <unk>
I think we have to do something with a part of the medical culture that has to change.
And I think this starts with a doctor, and that's me.
And I've spent enough time to let me give up a part of my false status on that.
Before I treat the theme of my talk, we talk a little bit of baseball.
Why not?
We're near the end, the World World <unk>
We love baseball, right?
baseball is full of amazing statistics.
There are hundreds of statistics.
It's about leaving the <unk> talking about statistics and use them to form a big baseball team.
I focus on one of them and I hope that many of you know about.
It's called the average <unk>
And we talk about 300 percent of a <unk> who will be <unk>
That means that <unk> bat <unk> three of 10 times.
That means throwing the ball to the game of play without being <unk> and anybody who is about throw it to the first base -- not to get to time, and the second foundation will be <unk>
Three of 10.
You know how they call a <unk> <unk> in the Great <unk>
Well, you know, maybe the team of stars.
You know how they call a baseball <unk>
And by the way, that is somebody who's in 10 crash, and we'll get four.
<unk> like the legendary Ted Williams, the last player of the League <unk> <unk> in running a smaller season in a regular season.
Now I'm going to take this to my world of medicine where I feel much more comfortable or maybe less uncomfortable, after what I'm going to tell you today.
Suppose you have <unk> and they are <unk> from a surgeon who has also a record of 400 in <unk>
So it doesn't work, right?
Now suppose that they live in a place, and a dear person has two arteries <unk> <unk> and his family doctor is derived to a cardiologist whose record in <unk> is <unk>
But you know something?
She is making a remarkably much better.
And your hits have been <unk>
This is not working.
But I'll ask you.
What do you believe that you must be the average of a heart surgeon or a <unk> or a nurse -- <unk>
<unk> very well.
And the truth of the matter is that nobody in medicine knows the hits of a good surgeon, a doctor or a <unk>
What we do, however, is <unk> to the world, and I would believe in the <unk>
That never, would ever make a mistake and try and figure out how to do it well.
That was the message that I was in medical school.
I was a student <unk> <unk>
Once, a fellow in high school said that Brian Goldman <unk> to a blood test.
Just like this.
<unk> in my little <unk> at the University of nurses at General Hospital in Toronto, not far from here.
And I learned all of the memory.
From my kind of anatomy, <unk> the origin and the muscle work, the <unk> of every artery that comes out of the <unk> the diagnostic diagnosis and the <unk>
And I even knew the differential diagnosis of how to form the <unk> <unk> <unk>
And as much more and more knowledge.
And I was very well; I graduated with <unk>
And <unk> from the medical school with the impression that if you were <unk> it would know everything, or as much as I can, close to everything, because I would get rid of mistakes.
And it worked for a while, until I met Mrs. <unk>
I was a resident at a college hospital here, in Toronto when they brought the lady back to the emergency service where I worked.
At that time I was assigned to the service of <unk>
And when the emergency room applied to a cardiologist I was going to go to that patient.
And I will report the head of residents.
When I saw the lady <unk> I was <unk>
I heard a <unk> sound.
And when the <unk> I heard a <unk> sound on both sides, which was <unk> <unk> heart failure.
In these conditions the heart stops working and instead of injecting blood forward, your blood goes to your lungs, these are filled with blood, and that's why there's difficulty breathing.
And it wasn't hard to <unk>
I did it and I started working on the treatment that I would give him.
I gave him <unk> and medication to ease the pressure on their heart.
I gave him <unk> water pills so that it could take liquid off.
And in an hour or two, she started feeling better.
And I sat very well.
And that's when I made the first <unk> he sent her home.
I actually made two more mistakes.
He sent her home without talking to the head of residents.
I didn't get up the phone and I did what I should have done, which was to call my boss and <unk> with him for the <unk>
And if my boss would have seen it, it would have been able to bring up information <unk>
Maybe I did it for a good reason.
I mean, I didn't want to be a resident to make constant attention.
Perhaps I wanted to be so successful and able to take <unk> who could take care of my patients without even contact my boss.
The second mistake I made was worse.
When I sent her home, I didn't pay attention to a voice in my inner saying, <unk> it's not a good idea. Don't do it."
In fact, I was so sure that until I asked the nurse to be asked to the lady <unk> "Do you believe that it's okay if you go to his <unk>
And the nurse thought, and then he said with total <unk> "Yes, I think I'm going to be right."
I remember that as if it was yesterday.
So he signed up the tall, and the ambulance along with the ambulance was taken home.
And I went back to the hospital.
The rest of that day, that afternoon, I had a bad <unk> in the stomach,
But I went on with my job.
At the end of the day, I went to leave the hospital and walked into the parking lot where my car was my car to go home. And I did something I did not normally do normally, at that time.
It went through the emergency service road service.
And another nurse, not that I was taking care of my lunch lady before, but the other one, she said to me, three words, those three words that most emergency doctors <unk>
Other specialists are afraid too, but there's a <unk> in <unk> and it's that we see the patients <unk>
The three words are <unk>
"They remember the patient who sent his <unk>
He asked the other nurse with total <unk>
And they said, "Well, she <unk> with the same voice.
She was fine.
But I went back and on the edge of death.
At the end of an hour to have come to his house, after I gave him the high school, he suffered a collapse and his family called the <unk> the ambulance the <unk> the <unk> the emergency pressure with a blood pressure of <unk> which means a shock of the <unk>
I barely breathe and was blue.
<unk> staff, all its resources.
They gave them medication to raise your blood pressure.
They put an artificial <unk>
I was <unk> and <unk> to the core.
He had a mix of feelings because after the <unk> was in intensive therapy and waiting for all hope that they were <unk>
And in the two or three days or three days it was obvious that I never <unk>
It had a permanent brain damage.
The family got together.
And in eight or nine days, it was <unk> to what was happening.
And the ninth day, they let him go. My wife <unk> wife, mom and grandmother.
They say they never forget the names that they die.
That was my first experience.
So the past few weeks I was excited about it, and I experienced for the first time the <unk> shame that exists in our medical culture, and I felt alone, without feeling that healthy shame because you can't deal with your colleagues.
You make peace and never more make that mistake.
It's that shame it leaves a teaching.
The shame shame that I talk about is that makes us feel very bad inside.
It's the one that tells us not what it was wrong, but we're bad guys.
And that felt.
And it wasn't because of my <unk> he was a <unk>
I talked to the family, and I'm sure I would go through the things and made sure that I didn't get <unk>
And I kept getting those questions.
Why didn't I ask my <unk> Why did he send her home?
And in my worst <unk> why did I make a mistake so <unk>
Why did we choose medicine?
Little about that feeling was <unk>
And I started to feel better.
And on a day <unk> it opened the sky and finally came out the sun. And I wondered if I would feel better again.
And I made a deal with me in which if I was going to get the efforts to be perfect to not make more mistakes I would always follow those voices.
And it did.
I went back to work.
But it went back to happen.
Two years later, it was a student in the emergency department in a community hospital north of Toronto, and I got a 25 year-old man with a pain in your throat.
I was very busy and <unk>
And he pointed out here.
I looked at her throat, I was a little bit <unk>
He sent him up and sent him home.
But as he ran to the door, he kept pointing out his throat.
Two days later, when I came to do my <unk> my head asked to talk to me <unk> in his office.
And I made the three words: remember you?
Remember the patient who saw for a pain in the <unk>
Well, he came back and didn't have a <unk> <unk>
I had a potentially deadly condition called <unk>
You can search for Google. It's an infection, not the throat, but it's going to be a higher area, and it can cause the closing of those tracks.
him, fortunately, not <unk>
He was <unk> antibiotics for <unk> and recovered at the few days.
And I went through the same period of shame and <unk> then I went back to work, until it happened again and again and again.
Two times in the same turn of the emergency turn of the <unk> not <unk>
And it's a great effort, and especially working in a hospital, because it was <unk> 14 patients at the same time.
But in both cases, I didn't send them home and I don't think it's been a <unk>
One of them thought I had a <unk> calculation in it.
And he was an X-ray shot, but it turned out a normal <unk> a colleague who was checking the patient really felt some sensitivity in the bottom right-hand corner and called the surgeon <unk>
The other patient was with a lot of diarrhea.
I read the liquid order to <unk> and I asked my colleague to <unk>
I looked at it and to notice some sensitivity in the lower right-hand quadrant, called the surgeon <unk>
Both of them were operated and they recovered well.
But every case I was <unk>
But I'd like to tell you that I made the worst mistakes in the first five years of exercise and like many colleagues say, it's a <unk>
The most meaningful has been over the last five years.
<unk> embarrassed and without support.
And here's the problem: if I can't tell you and talk about my mistakes, if I can't find the <unk> that tells me what really happens, how could I share this with my <unk>
How do I teach them this to make the same <unk>
If I go into a place like this, I would have no idea what you think about me.
When was the last time you heard someone talking about failure, after failure, after failure?
Of course, at a party you'll hear about the errors of other doctors, but you'll not hear someone talking about their own mistakes.
And if I knew and my colleagues as well, that a <unk> in my hospital <unk> the wrong leg -- believe it would have difficulty looking at the eyes.
This is the system that we have.
The total denial of mistakes.
It's the system where there are two <unk> those who make mistakes and the ones that no, which you can't sleep and I know -- those who have <unk> outcomes and those who have great outcomes.
And it's almost like an antibody reaction that starts to attack that person.
We have the idea that if we care about medicine to people who make mistakes, we will become safe system.
But that brings two problems.
In 20 years, about diffusion and medical journalism -- I've done a <unk> personal study and medical medical study to learn how possible, from the first article I wrote for Toronto, "Star <unk> Black <unk> <unk> white, <unk> art.
And what I learned is that mistakes are <unk>
We work in a system where mistakes will happen every single day, where one in 10 drugs are going to be in the hospital are wrong, or <unk> is not right, in a system in which traditional infections, infections, are more and more <unk> causing chaos and death.
In this country, 10,000 Canadian <unk> were killed by medical <unk>
The U.S. Institute Institute in the United States established <unk>
In both cases, it's about <unk> <unk> because we're not <unk> the problem as we should.
And so they are.
A <unk> system where knowledge is going on every two or three years, and we don't get <unk>
sleep deprivation. All of sleep <unk>
And we can't get rid of it.
We have cognitive biases that allow us to make a perfect history of a patient with chest pain.
Now, let's take the same patient with a pain in his chest, comes with <unk> eyes, and with breath to alcohol and all of a sudden, my story <unk> from contempt.
It's not the same story.
I'm not a <unk> I don't do the same way.
And my patients are not cars. They don't <unk> their symptoms always in the same way.
All of this, the mistakes are inevitable.
So if we took the system as we were <unk> and we eliminated all the professionals prone well, you won't get anybody.
And with respect to people don't want to talk about their most <unk>
In my <unk> <unk> <unk> art -- it's already a custom to say, "This is my worst <unk> I would say to everybody, from the <unk> to the head of surgery, <unk> "This is my worst <unk> blah, blah, "What are your <unk> And I <unk> the microphone to them.
And his students were <unk> <unk> <unk> his head and <unk> saliva and started telling their stories.
They want to tell their stories, they want to share them.
<unk> power to say, "Look, don't make the same <unk>
They need a context where they can do it.
They need a <unk> medical culture.
And it starts with a doctor every time.
The Jewish doctor is human, they know -- they accept it, they accept it, and they're not proud of their mistakes, but they try to learn from what happened to teach others.
It <unk> their experiences with them.
It's support for those who talk about their mistakes.
<unk> the errors of other people not with intention of <unk> but in a loving way and support for all of them <unk>
And it works in a medical culture that recognizes human beings run the system, and when this happens, it happens to be done in a while.
My name is Brian <unk>
I'm a <unk> doctor.
I'm human, <unk> mistakes.
And I feel a lot of effort to learn something that can convey to others.
I don't know what you think about me, but I can live with that.
And let me conclude with three words -- I remember.
Do you know how many decisions we take a day <unk>
Do you know how much we choose a week?
I recently did a survey over 2,000 people and the average amount of choices that says to choose a average American is about 70 to a day.
It doesn't make a long research on a research for a week to a group of companies.
The researchers recorded the different tasks driven by these executives and the time that we were trying to make decisions related to those tasks.
They found that, on average, <unk> <unk> <unk> a week.
Naturally, every work included a lot of <unk>
Half of those decisions took nine minutes or less.
Only 12 percent required one hour or more of your time.
Now think about their choices.
Do you know how many people belong to the <unk> category and how many of the <unk>
How do you figure out how to deal with those decisions?
Today I want to talk about one of the biggest problems of <unk> choosing to <unk>
I want to talk about the problem and about possible solutions.
As I talk about this, I'm going to ask you a few questions and I need to know your answers.
When I ask a question, like I'm blind, you raise your hand just if you want to burn calories.
Otherwise, when you ask a question, if your answer is positive please give you a <unk>
And now my first question of the day, they're ready to hear about the problem of <unk> <unk> problem.
Thank you.
And I was a graduate student at Stanford University, <unk> this <unk> <unk> at least at that time was very sophisticated <unk>
It was called <unk>
It was almost like going to an amusement park.
There were like 250 different kinds of mustard and <unk> over 500 different types of fruits and vegetables and about 25 of 25 water <unk> and this was when we were taking water from the tap.
I loved going to that store, but I was asking myself, why never do nothing?
This is the shelf from <unk> oil.
They had more than 75 different classes, including the ones that were in box <unk> that came from trees.
I once decided to visit the manager and I asked him, <unk> this strategy of offering all these <unk>
He pointed to me the full <unk> buses that came up every day, usually with their cameras.
So we decided to do a little experiment with <unk> This is the <unk>
hall.
They had different kinds of different classes.
<unk> a <unk> for <unk> right to the tent.
We put out of six <unk> or 24 flavors -- different flavors and we look at two things: First, what case people were willing to stop testing the <unk>
More people had been stopped when I had a fence that when there were just six, 40 percent.
We also looked at what case they were more likely to buy a jar of <unk>
Here's the opposite effect.
What stopped when there were 24, only three percent came to buy <unk>
What they stood when there were six, we saw 30 percent bought <unk>
If we do the calculations, people had six times as likely to buy <unk> if they were six.
Well, to decide that we can't buy <unk> we probably <unk> -- less is good to preserve the <unk> but it turns out that the problem of women's <unk> affects us in good <unk> decisions.
We decided not to decide, even though this is not <unk>
Now the issue of the day, the financial <unk>
I'm going to describe a study that I did with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> where we look at decisions about savings for retirement of a million Americans, between a million Americans, from about 650 plans in this country.
And we were interested in seeing if the number of <unk> money available to savings for preventing the <unk> program, to save people to save for the future.
And we found that I really had a <unk>
We had plans that went from two, to 59 different choices.
We found that the bigger the number of funding was the number of <unk> <unk>
So if you look at the extreme ways, we see that in the plans that offer two funds, the rate of participation was 70 or more, not as high as it wanted to.
And in the plans that offer about 60 funding, the rate of participation went to the 50th 1960s.
It turns out that even if you decide to participate, when there is more options, even in that case, there's negative consequences.
So for those who decided to participate, the greater the number of choices, more people were <unk> to avoid actions or hedge funds.
As soon as there was more options, they were more willing to invest in financial rates of market.
But none of these extreme decisions are the ones that we are talking about to optimize the future financial well-being.
In the previous decade we've seen three major negative consequences by providing more and more possibilities.
The most likely thing is that we make the decision, the decision, even when it goes against the self-interest to do.
They're more likely to take the worst decisions in finance and health.
They are more likely to pick things down -- less <unk> even though it is going to be better.
The main reason is that we have to look at that giant array of <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> but we are not able to do the calculations so we can contrast and pick out that awesome <unk>
Today I want to give you four simple techniques that we've collected in one way or another, in different research, so that you can test in their businesses.
The first is, <unk>
You already heard it before, but it's never been more true than today, that less is more.
People are always upset when I say, <unk>
They care about losing space in the <unk>
But actually what we're looking at is that if you choose to cut, then you get rid of <unk> <unk> <unk> there will be a increase in sales <unk> there's going to be a better experience in choice.
When I <unk> & <unk> went from 26 types of <unk> & <unk> at 15, you saw a 10 percent increase in sales.
When the corporation <unk> <unk> eliminated the products for <unk> of cats that less <unk> increased <unk> on <unk> by two <unk> bigger sales and lower costs.
You know that today's <unk> on average, offer 45,000 products.
In a Walmart store that's about 100,000 products.
But the second largest store in the world today is <unk> and offers just 1,400 <unk> a kind of tomato sauce <unk>
In the financial savings world, I think one of the best examples that you have emerged about how to handle the choices is David <unk> the Harvard program.
All the Harvard employees are automatically <unk> to a safe fund of life.
For the people who really want to choose to be 20 <unk> not 300 or more.
You know, often people say, "I don't know how to <unk>
All of these are choices.
The first thing I do is ask the <unk> <unk> the differences that there are among those options.
And if your employees can't afford them, you can't do their <unk>
This afternoon, before I started this session, I was talking to <unk>
He told me that he would be willing to offer people from this audience a holiday with all paid to the most beautiful road in the world.
Here, a <unk>
I want you to <unk>
I'm going to leave a few seconds to <unk> and then I want you to give you a hand if you're ready to take the supply of <unk>
<unk> <unk> All right. You're ready to accept the deal.
They're not more?
Well, I'm going to show you something else.
You knew there was a trick.
Who is ready for that <unk>
I think I really got to hear more hands.
All right.
In fact, you had more information in the first <unk> than in the second one, but I can tell you that they thought the second time was real.
Because the images were made to be seen.
This brings me to the second technique to handle the problem of choice <unk> which is <unk>
For people people understand the differences between choice, they have to understand the consequences of each option, and that the consequences must be very <unk> very concrete ways.
Why are people spending about 30 percent more on average when it uses debit card or credit card than when it uses enough.
Because it doesn't seem real money.
It turns out to make it even more real, it can be a very positive tool for people to make it more <unk>
So we did a study with <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> on <unk> <unk> staff who worked in <unk> these people were at a meeting where they were <unk> to a <unk> plan.
And at that meeting, we were going to see exactly how we did a little <unk>
What we added was we introduced the staff to think of the positive things that we would think about in their lives if they were saving more money.
With this <unk> there was an increase in the <unk> of 20 and an increase in the number that they were interested in saving or what they wanted to put in their accounts for <unk> <unk>
The third technique is <unk>
We can handle more categories than options.
For example, this is a study that we did in a aisle of magazines.
What we saw is that in supermarket. It went along the <unk> <unk> the exhibition of magazines can contain from <unk> different types to <unk>
But you know?
Because <unk> tells me how to <unk>
These are two exhibitions of <unk>
One is called <unk> and the other, <unk>
If you think the one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk>
<unk> <unk> Well, there are a few.
If you think the one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk>
Well, something else.
It turns out it's right.
The one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> but you know something?
This rating scheme is totally useless.
<unk> must indicate something to you who you are not going to do that the <unk>
You often see this problem with those huge lists of funds.
I mean, who are they <unk>
My fourth <unk> <unk> complexity.
It turns out that we can handle a lot more information than what we think, if you just get it a little bit.
We have to increase economic complexity.
I'm going to show you an example of what I mean.
Let's look at a good decision, the purchase of a car.
This is a German German manufacturer of cars that enables <unk>
You have to take 60 decisions, to build the car.
And these decisions vary in the number of options that offers each other.
<unk> outside of the car. I've got 56 possibilities.
<unk> <unk> box.
What I'm going to do is change the order that the decisions come in.
So half of the customers are going to go from many choices, 56 colors, just a few little boxes.
The other half of the clients will go for a few choices, four boxes, 56 colors, many options.
And what am I going to <unk>
So what involved you are.
If you get <unk> always the default button on each decision, this indicates that they're <unk> or <unk> we're being lost.
We found that those who are going from a lot of options to <unk> <unk> the default button and again, and another one.
<unk>
If you go from a few options to many, they continue there.
The same information, the same number of options.
The only thing I did was alter the order of the information that information.
If we start with the easy, you learn to <unk>
Even though the pick is not going to say nothing about the preferences of interior <unk> in all ways we are preparing to choose.
We're excited about a product that we're building now has more <unk> with the process.
To wrap up.
I've talked about four techniques to mitigate the problem of <unk> <unk> <unk> eliminating alternative <unk> <unk> to make it <unk> <unk> we can handle more categories with fewer <unk> <unk> complexity.
All of these techniques that I have introduced to you were designed to help handle <unk> or better, to use them in their own business, or for the people who are going to work.
It's that I think the key to the best of a choice is being careful about the <unk>
And the more you can be in our better choices we can practice the art of choice.
Thank you very much.
In the 1970s in the <unk> East Germany, I was <unk> if you had a typewriter I had to write in the government.
I had to register a piece of text text with the machine.
And this is why the government could track the origin of <unk>
If they found a written message with the wrong message, you could track the footprint to the origin of the idea.
In the West we don't think that someone could do this, how much this would make that freedom of expression.
We would never do that in our countries.
But today, in 2011, if you buy a laser color laser printer and printing a page, that page will end up having some yellow dots on each page that you follow a pattern that makes them their own one and your printer.
That's happening today.
And nobody seems to be a lot of <unk>
This is an example of the ways that our governments use technology against us, citizens.
And it's one of the three main causes of problems in the network.
If we see what happens in the online world we can set up the attacks on their <unk>
There are three main groups.
Are you the <unk>
Like Mr. <unk> <unk> from the city of <unk> in Ukraine.
<unk> cell phone is very easy to understand.
These guys make money.
They use the cyberattacks to make a lot of money, a lot of them amounts.
There are really many cases of <unk> online, <unk> <unk> money with their attacks.
This is <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk>
This is Alfred <unk>
This is Stephen <unk>
This is <unk> <unk>
These are Matthew Anderson, <unk> <unk> etc., etc.
These guys are doing their online <unk> but they do it by illegal media by <unk> to steal the money from our accounts when we buy in <unk> or steal our keys to get information from our cards when we bought on a <unk> computer.
The U.S. secret service ago, two months ago, <unk> the Swiss account of this guy, Sam <unk> and this account was <unk> million dollars when it was frozen frozen.
Mr. <unk> is <unk> you don't know his <unk>
And I say that today is more likely than any of us is a victim of a <unk> than a real crime.
And it's very obvious that this is going to be <unk>
In the future, most crime crimes online.
The second rating group in importance that we see today is not driven by the money.
There's another thing that moves, and the protests, they motivate them to motivate you laughter.
Groups like Anonymous have <unk> over the last 12 months occupying a role in online attacks.
Those are the three main bombers criminals who do it for money, the <unk> like Anonymous who do it for protest and the last group are the national states, the governments that are <unk>
And then we see cases like <unk>
That's a good example of government attack against its own citizens.
<unk> is an authority of <unk> of the Netherlands or, actually, it was.
It will take the collapse last fall because of a <unk>
Do you take the safety of the site and share a <unk>
Last week, I was asked, in a meeting with government representatives by Dutch government, asked one of the leaders if they <unk> <unk> death of people because of the attack to <unk>
And the answer of it was yes.
So how people die of a cause of these?
<unk> is an <unk> authority.
<unk> <unk>
So what do the <unk>
Well, you need if you have a website with <unk> services like <unk>
Except to <unk> an official foreign authority.
And that gave us a <unk>
And in the case of <unk> it happened exactly that.
And what happened in the Arab Spring and those things that have happened, for example, in <unk>
Well, in Egypt in Egypt -- the headquarters in the Egyptian police headquarters in April 2011, and during the University of the building, they found a lot of papers.
Among those papers was this folder called <unk>
And within that folder there was notes from a company based in Germany that had sold the Egyptian government tools to intercept the communications of citizens in the country.
They had sold this tool for 40,000 euros the government <unk>
The company headquarters is right here.
I mean, the Western governments provide us tools to <unk> governments to do this to their citizens.
But Western governments are doing this themselves.
For example, in Germany, only a couple of weeks ago, I found the <unk> <unk> a <unk> used by official government officials to research their own citizens.
If you're suspicious in a criminal case -- well, it's pretty obvious that your phone is <unk>
But today it goes further.
They are <unk> the connection to the Internet.
We had even tools like <unk> <unk> to infect our computer with a <unk> to allow them to see all the communication, and listen to the online discussions to get our data.
When we think close into things like these obvious answer should be, "Well, it seems a bad thing, but it doesn't really affect me because I'm an honest citizen.
Why <unk>
I have nothing to <unk>
And that argument doesn't make sense.
It's in play.
Privacy is not <unk>
It's not a matter of privacy against safety.
It's about freedom against control.
If we could rely on our governments today in 2011, any right that we will come up with today, will be forever.
Are you <unk> in any future government in a administration that we could have within 50 years?
These are the questions that must be worried about the next 50 years.
This is where I live, I live in Kenya, in the South Park of Nairobi.
These are the cows of my dad at the bottom, and behind the cows, the National Park in Nairobi.
The National Park in Nairobi doesn't have fences at most of the south, which means that wild animals like <unk> migrate freely out of the park.
And predators, like lions, and this is what they do.
<unk> our cattle.
This is one of the ones that killed at night, and so soon we wake up in the morning and found it dead -- I felt so bad because it was the only <unk> that we had.
My community, the <unk> we think we came out of the sky with our animals and all the land to <unk> and so we value it so much.
So I grew up <unk> a lot to lions.
They were dying are warriors who protect our community and livestock, and they're also annoyed with the problem.
So they kill lions.
This is one of the six lions that killed in Nairobi.
I think that's so few in the National Park in Nairobi.
A child in my community, at six to nine years old, is responsible for her father's livestock and this was the same thing to me.
So I had to find a way to solve this problem.
My first idea was to use fire, because I thought male lions will be afraid.
But I realized that this really didn't go out because it even helped the lions look at the pen from far.
I didn't get <unk> <unk>
A second idea was to use a <unk>
And I was trying to trick the lions so they believed it was near the <unk>
But male lions are very smart.  They came the first day and saw the <unk> and they were, but the second day, it came back and said, this thing is not moving, it's always here.  So he went and killed the animals.
So one night I was walking around the pen with a torch and the lions did not come out.
I found that lions are afraid to the light that's moving.
So I had an idea.
And I got a switch on which to turn on and off the lights.
And this is a little <unk> <unk>
<unk> everything.
As you can see, the solar cell load the battery and the battery <unk> the electricity to the small box -- I call it a transformative.
And the <unk> box makes the lights go.
As you can see, the <unk> give out the outside, because that's where lions.
And that's how you see this lions when they come at night.
And the lights were <unk> and I would go to lions to think that I'm walking through the <unk> but I'm sleeping in my bed.
Thank you.
So I put them in my house two years ago, and since then, we never went back to the <unk>
And the neighborhood houses heard the idea.
One of them is from this grandmother.
She had killed a lot of animals that male lions and asked me if he could put the lights.
I said yes.
You know, you can see at the bottom, these are the lights for lions.
Since then, I've been installed in seven houses in my community, and they're serving a lot of me.
And my idea is also used now for all Kenya, to scare other predators as hyenas, <unk> and it's also using to make up elephants from farms.
Because of this invention, I was fortunate to get a scholarship in one of the best schools in Kenya, <unk> International School, and I'm very excited.
My new school is now helping to raise funds and <unk>
It even took my friends to my community and set up lights in the houses that they don't have them, and I teach them how to <unk>
So a year ago, I was just a kid in the meadows of the savanna <unk> the cows of my father, and used to see flying airplanes, and he said that some day would be inside one.
And here I am.
I got the opportunity to come into an airplane for the first time to TED.
My great dream is to get to be an engineer of aviation and a pilot when you go.
I used to hate the lions, but now as my invention is saving cows from my dad and to lions, we can be with lions without conflict.
<unk> <unk> What in my language means, thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: You don't picture how exciting you can listen to a story like you.
So you get a <unk> Richard <unk> Yes.
CA: You're working on other electrical <unk>
What's the next thing in your list?
<unk> My next invention -- I want to do a fence to be called CA: A close to <unk>
<unk> I know you have invented electric fences -- but I want to do my own.
CA: You know, one time, right now, and I have tried it before, but I have tried it before, but I just got a <unk>  CA: On the morning, Richard <unk> is a big thing.
We're going to be <unk> in every single step that I get a friend of mine.
Thank you very much. <unk> Thank you very much.
When I was a little, I thought my country was the best of the planet.
And I grew up singing a song called "No <unk> <unk>
And I felt very proud.
In school, we would find all the time studying Kim <unk> story -- but we never learned a lot of the rest of the world, except America, South Korea, Japan are the enemies.
Even though I was wondering about the rest of the world, I thought that would happen all my life in North Korea, until it all changed suddenly.
When I was seven years old, I saw my first public performance.
But I thought my life in North Korea was normal.
My family wasn't poor and I was never hungry.
But one day, in 1995, my mom brought home a letter from my sister.
And he said, "When I <unk> this, the five members of the family will stop there in this world, because we haven't eaten in the last two weeks.
We're putting together on the floor, and our bodies are so weak, that we're prepared to die."
I was very <unk>
It was the first time I heard that people were suffering in my country.
At a little time when I was walking in front of the train station, I saw something terrible that I can't erase my memory.
A woman without life was dead on the street, holding a child <unk> in her arms looking at her face of his mother without being able to do anything.
No one was the <unk> because they were very concerned about taking care of them and their families.
A huge famine goes to North Korea to the <unk>
In the end, over a million North America died during famine and only few they survived grass, insects and sewage cortex.
It also became more and more prevalent energy <unk> all around me was completely dark in the night except for the sea lights in China, just crossing the river from my house.
I always wondered why they had light and we don't.
This is a satellite picture of North Korea in the night compared to the neighboring countries.
This is the <unk> River.
As you can see, the river can be very <unk> in certain points, allowing North America to cross <unk>
But many people die.
Sometimes, I see bodies floating in the river, so.
I can't reveal the details of how I left North Korea, but I can only say that during the years of starvation was sent to China to live with relatives <unk>
But I just thought I'd be separated from my family for the short time.
I could never have imagined that it would take 14 years to live together.
In China, it was hard to live as a young woman without my family.
I had no idea what life would be like refugee <unk>
But I soon learned that it's not just extremely difficult, but also dangerous, because the refugees North America in China were considered illegal immigrants in China.
So I was living with a constant fear that my identity was <unk> and it would be <unk> to a horrible fate back in North Korea.
A day -- my worst nightmare was actually made when I was arrested for the Chinese police and <unk> in the police station.
Somebody had accused me about being <unk> then I would tell my skills in the Chinese language and asked me a lot of questions.
I was <unk>
I thought my heart was going to exploit.
If it didn't seem natural, it could be incarcerated and <unk>
I thought my life was going to end.
But I managed to control my emotions and said the questions.
At the end of the interrogation a officer told another, "This was a fake <unk> She's not <unk>
And they let me go. It was a miracle.
Some North Koreans are looking for asylum <unk> <unk>
But many can be arrested for the Chinese police and <unk>
These women were very lucky.
Although there were them eventually released after a harsh international pressure.
These North Koreans were not so lucky.
Every year, countless North Koreans are captured in China and <unk> North Korea, where they're <unk> incarcerated or executed in public.
Although I was lucky to escape many other North Koreans have not been so lucky.
It's tragic that North Koreans have to hide their identities and fight so hard just to survive.
Even after learning a new language and find work -- all their world can be <unk>
That's why after 10 years of hide my identity, I decided I would have a chance to go to South Korea.
And I started a new life again.
I was in South Korea was a much bigger challenge than I had expected.
English was very important in South Korea, I had to start learning my third language.
Also, I understood that there was a big gap between North and South.
We're all <unk> but inside, we have become very different because of 67 years of <unk>
It even went through an identity.
I'm a <unk> or <unk>
Where am I?
Suddenly there was no country I could call with a pride of mine.
Even though I went to the life in South Korea wasn't easy, I did a plan. I started studying for the exam exam to college.
Just when I started to <unk> my new life, I got an alarming call.
The North Korean authorities of North Korean -- some money that I sent to my family, and as <unk> my family was going to be displaced to the force to a location from the <unk>
They had to flee immediately.
I started planning how to help them escape.
North Koreans have to travel long distances on the way to freedom.
It's almost impossible to cross the border between North and South Korea.
So, ironically, I took a flight to China and went to the border to North Korea.
Because my family could not speak Chinese, I had to make it somehow, for over 3,000 miles across China and then through Southeast Asia.
The journey in <unk> took a week, and we almost got caught several times.
Once, our bus was stopped and <unk> by a Chinese police officer.
He asked the sake of all of us and started asking them questions.
As my family couldn't understand Chinese, I thought my family was going to be arrested.
When the Chinese official came over to my family, <unk> I stood up and said that they were <unk> people who were <unk>
And I looked at me <unk> but I was fortunately believed to me.
We did all the way to the border of <unk>
But I had to spend almost all my money to bribe the border C.O.s in <unk>
But even after spending the border, my family was arrested and incarcerated for crossing the border <unk>
After paying <unk> and <unk> my family was liberated in a month.
But the time, my family was arrested and incarcerated again in <unk> capital.
This was one of the lowest points in my life.
I did everything to liberate my family, and we were so close, but my family was <unk> in prison at short distance from the embassy embassy embassy
I was going and came between the immigration office and the police station, desperately trying to release my family.
But I didn't have enough money to pay more bribes or <unk>
I lost hope.
At that time, or the voice of a man wondering, "What is the problem?"
I was so surprised that a stranger would mind questions.
With my poor English and a dictionary -- I told him the situation, and without <unk> the man went to the ATM and gave me the rest of the money for my family and for other two North Koreans and <unk>
I went through all my heart, and I asked him, "Why did I <unk>
"I'm not <unk> he told you.
"I'm helping the village <unk>
I realized that was a symbolic moment in my life.
The kind of <unk> <unk> a new hope for me and for the people to get older, when they get more <unk>
And I showed me that the kindness of strangers and the support of the international community are really the asset of hope that the <unk> people.
Over time, after our long journey, my family and I came together in South Korea.
But the freedom is only half the battle.
Many North Koreans are separated from their families and when they went to a new country, they start with a little bit or no money.
So we can benefit from the international community with education, practical language language, practices, and more.
We can also act as a bridge between people within North Korea and the rest of the world.
Because many of us are still in contact with family <unk> and we send information and money that is helping to change North Korea from the inside.
I've been very <unk> I've gotten a lot of help and inspiration in my life, so I want to help North Koreans an opportunity to thrive with international support.
I'm sure you're going to see more and more North North North America, including on the TED stage.
Thank you.
I live in South Pole.
This is the <unk> stores of <unk> food, fast food <unk>
So the city planners got together and they thought, we're going to change the Southern Center to represent something else, so they changed it to Los Angeles as if this is going to be <unk> what's actually wrong in the city.
This is Los Angeles <unk>  <unk> of <unk> fast food <unk>
Just like <unk> millions of other American Americans live in a food desert, Los Angeles Center, home of food places to take and eat in the car.
The curious thing is that the food places to take more people than food in the car.
People are dying of heart disease in Los Angeles and South America.
For example, the obesity rate in my neighborhood is five times older than say, <unk> <unk> which is like 15 miles away.
I was glad to see this happen.
And I ask myself, how would you feel if you don't have access to healthy food, and if you go out of the house, you see the <unk> effects that the current food system has in their <unk>
I see chairs, chairs, and sold like <unk> cars.
I see <unk> centers like <unk>
And I think this needs to stop.
I think the problem is the solution.
Food is the problem, and it's the solution.
And I also got tired of running 45 minutes to go back to buy an apple that has <unk>
What I did, was planting a food forest in front of my house.
In a sliver of land that we call a <unk>
It's 45 feet by four feet.
The point is, it belongs to the city.
But you have to <unk>
I said, "Well, I can do what comes to me at <unk> because it's my responsibility and I have to <unk>
This is how I decided to <unk>
So my group and I, L.A. <unk> we got together and we started planting our forest forest -- trees -- you know, nine vegetables.
What we do, we are a kind of paid paid money ahead of the rest of the entire city and completely voluntary and everything we do is free.
And the garden, was beautiful.
Then someone gets <unk>
The city looked at me and at <unk> I was given a <unk> saying that I had to take my garden, the <unk> made <unk>
And I said, "Come on, in right?
A <unk> order for plant food in a piece of land that nobody would <unk>  So I was like, "Well, <unk>
Because this time was not going to happen.
L.A. Times had the story written by Steve <unk> and I talked to the <unk> and one of the Green <unk> who put a petition in <unk> with 900 <unk> and we were a success.
We had the victory in our hands.
My <unk> even called to say, <unk> and <unk> what we were doing.
I mean, come on, why not?
L.A. is the city of America.
It's three miles of <unk> <unk>
That equals 20 Central <unk>
That is enough space for planting millions of <unk>
Why on earth don't look like this?
It will give a thousand seeds. 10,000 seeds.
When a dollar of <unk> I'll give you <unk>
It's my <unk> when I tell people, they cultivate your own food.
<unk> your own food is like print your own money.
You see, I have a legacy for South
I grew up there. It was my children there.
And I became a part of this <unk> reality that was <unk> for me, and I'm going to give you my own reality.
You see, I'm an artist.
<unk> is my <unk> I cultivate my art.
As an artist from <unk> that <unk> walls, <unk> soils, you <unk>
I use the garden, the land, as a piece of canvas, and plants and trees, are my <unk> of that canvas.
You'd be surprised to see what the earth can do, if you leave their canvas.
You just can't imagine how amazing it is a sunflower and how it affects people.
What happened?
I witnessed how my garden became a tool of education, a transformation in my neighborhood.
To change the community, you have to change the composition of the land.
We are the land.
You'd be surprised to see how it affects the kids.
gardening is the <unk> act and provocative act that they can do, especially in a <unk>
Also, they get <unk>
I remember one occasion, who came up with a mother and her daughter, were like the <unk> of the night and they were in my garden, I went out and looked very <unk>
I, well, man, man, I felt bad in there, and I said, you know, you don't have to do this.
This is on the street for a reason.
I felt embarrassment when you see people that I was so close to me with hunger, and this is just <unk> why I do this, people ask me, <unk> not temes that people are going to steal your <unk>
So I say, "For God no, I'm not afraid you're going to go <unk>
That's the street.
That's what it's about.
I want you to take it, but at his time, I want you to <unk> your <unk>
There was another time when I put a garden in a <unk> shelter in the center of Los Angeles.
They were these guys, who helped me download the truck.
It was great, they gave me their stories about how this had been affected and how they used to plant with their mom and her grandmother, and it was fabulous to see how this changed, so it was just for a moment.
So the Green <unk> has come to plant maybe 20 <unk>
We've had about 50 people who come from, work and <unk> all of them in voluntary plan.
If kids are growing <unk> the kids will eat <unk>
If you grow <unk> you will eat <unk>  But if nothing of this will be told if you don't teach them how food is to affect your mind and the body, eat blind what you put in front of you.
I see young people who want to work, but they have this thing that you're stuck. I see guys of color that are on this path designed for them, that it doesn't take them anywhere else.
With <unk> I see an opportunity in which we can train these kids to get rid of their communities to have a sustainable life.
And when we do this, who knows?
Maybe the next George Washington <unk>
But if we don't change the composition of land, we never will.
Now this is one of my plans -- this is something I want to do.
I want to plant a whole block of gardens, where people can share food in the same block.
I want to take containers and turn them in <unk>
I didn't get <unk>
I'm not talking about free, because it's not sustainable.
The funny thing about sustainability, is you have to <unk>
What I talk about is to try to get people to get people out of the street, they know the joy, the pride and pride and honor to grow their own food, opening farmers.
What I want to do here, we have to do sexy.
I want you all to become <unk> <unk> <unk> gardeners <unk>
We have to change the script of what's a <unk>
If you're not a <unk> you're not a <unk>
Is the <unk> take their <unk>
That is your weapon of choice.
In <unk> if you want to meet with me, well, if you want to see me, I won't be sitting in comfortable chairs and have meetings to talk about making some <unk> to talk about doing a shit.
If you want to see me, come to the garden with your <unk> so that we can plant something.
Peace Thank you.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk>  <unk> from the <unk>  I probably will all agree with me in which this is a very nice road at all.
It's made from <unk> and the asphalt is a good material to drive, but not always, especially not in days like today, where it rains a lot.
You can have a lot of water on the asphalt that we will see.
And especially if you go into your bicycle and these cars go, that's not really nice.
Also, the asphalt can make a lot of noise.
It's a noisy material and if we build roads, as the Netherlands, close to the cities, we want a quiet road to the cities, we'd want a quiet road.
The solution for that is to make roads on asphalt <unk>
The asphalt <unk> a material that we use now in most roads in the Netherlands, has pores and water can move through it, so all of the rain water will flow down the sides and have a road that is easy to drive, and not <unk> water never more.
The noise also disappear in these <unk>
Because it's very open, the whole noise -- so it's a very quiet road.
It also has <unk> of course, and the downside of this road is that you can <unk>
What is <unk> See that on this road the stones on the surface goes off.
So first a stone, then several more and more, and so on, and then then -- well, I will not do that.  But you can hurt your <unk> and you won't be happy with that.
And finally, this can also lead to more and more damage.
Sometimes you can create bumps with that.
<unk> It's ready.
<unk> of course, you can turn into a problem, but we have a solution.
So here you can actually see the damage in this material.
It's a asphalt asphalt as I said, so it only has a little amount of <unk> between stones.
Because of the <unk> to the light <unk> to the <unk> this <unk> this <unk> the glue between the <unk> <unk> and if they were <unk> they'll be committed to the <unk>
So if you drive along the road, you get the <unk> as we saw here.
To solve this problem, we think of materials of <unk>
If we can make this material <unk> then we probably have a solution.
So what we can do is use steel knitting from that to clean <unk> and we can cut out of steel knitting into very small pieces, and we can mix those little pieces with the <unk>
So we have asphalt with little pieces of steel <unk> in it.
Then you need a machine, like what you see here, that you use for <unk> a <unk> machine.
<unk> can heat, especially steel, is very good at that.
So what you have to do is to heat the steel, melt the <unk> flow through these <unk> and rocks become again on the surface.
Today I used an microwave oven, because I can't bring the big machine back here onstage.
The microwave oven, is a similar system.
I put the sample that I'm now going to get to see what happened.
This is the sample that comes out now.
I said we have this kind of industrial machine in the lab to heat the samples.
We tried a lot of samples there, and then the government, actually saw our results, and they thought, "Well, that's really interesting. We have to <unk>
So we gave us a piece of road, 400 meters from the <unk> <unk> where we had to do a lane of trial to test this material.
So that was what we did there. You see where we were doing the test on the road, and then, of course, this road will last several years without any damage. That's what we know about practice.
We take many samples of this road and test them in the lab.
We made the samples, we put a lot of burden on them, we put them up with our <unk> machine and the <unk> and we went back to it.
We can repeat this many times.
Well, to conclude, I can say that we've made a material using steel, bringing these fibers, using the energy of <unk> to actually increase the lives of the surface of the road, even they can double the life of the surface of the surface -- actually will save a lot of money with very simple tricks.
And now, of course, they are curious about this too.
We still have the sample here. It's pretty hot.
It really has to cool first before that I can show you how they behave like.
But I'm going to make a try.
Let's see. Yeah, it worked.
Thank you.
When I was 11 years old, I remember having woken up one morning with the sound of the <unk> in my house.
My father was listening BBC in his little gray radius.
I had a great smile in his face that was unusual at the time, because the news usually <unk>
<unk> got <unk> screamed at my father.
I didn't know what to do, but I could see my father was very, very happy.
"Now you can go to a school of <unk> he said.
One morning I will never forget.
A real school.
You see, I was six years old when the Taliban got rid of Afghanistan and made illegal girls go to school.
For the next five years, I was <unk> as a child to <unk> my older sister who was no longer alone to go to a secret school.
It was the only way the two could be able to do.
Every day, we were taking a different route so that no one could suspect where they were going.
We had to hide books in market bags so that it looks like we were shopping.
The school was at a house, more than 100 of us together in a small room.
It was nice in the winter, but it's extremely <unk>
We all knew we were going to do our <unk> the teacher, the students and our parents.
Every once in a while, school was suddenly closed for a week, because the Taliban <unk>
We always wondered what they did.
They were <unk>
Did you know where to <unk>
We were <unk> but yet, the school was where we wanted to be.
I was very lucky to grow in a family where education was <unk> and the daughters a <unk>
My grandfather was an extraordinary man for his time.
A total <unk> from a remote province in Afghanistan, in which his daughter, my mother, out to school, and so her father was <unk>
But my mother got a teacher.
This is it.
It took two years ago, just to turn our house into school for girls and women in our neighborhood.
And my father, this is the first of his family in getting education.
There was no doubt that their children had to receive education, even their daughters, despite the risks.
For him, there was a greater risk for him, to educate their children.
Over the years of <unk> I remember there was moments when I was very frustrated by our life and was always scared and I didn't see a future.
I wanted to give up, but my father said, <unk> daughter -- you can lose everything you have in life.
You can steal your money. You can take your house for a war.
But there is one thing that will always be with you, what is here and if we have to sell our blood to pay your education, we will.
So you still want to do it.
I have 22 years now.
I grew up in a country that has been destroyed by decades of war.
Less than six percent of the women in my age have more than the <unk> and if my family hadn't been so committed to my education, I would be one of them.
Instead, I find myself proud to graduate graduate school at all.
When I came back to Afghanistan, my grandfather, which was <unk> her home for the courage to educate her daughters, was one of the first ones in <unk>
He wasn't just <unk> from my university degree, but also that I was the first woman, and I am the first woman, I wear it down the streets in Kabul.
My family believe in me.
I was a big dream -- but my family has even bigger dreams for <unk>
That's why I'm the global ambassador to <unk> a global campaign to educate women.
This is why they <unk> <unk> the first one, and maybe the only private school for girls in Afghanistan, a country that is still risky for girls to go to school.
The exciting thing is I see students in my school with the strong desire to take the opportunity.
And I look at their parents and their families who, as my mine, <unk> for them, despite a opposition to an opposition.
As <unk> It's not your real name, and I can't show you your face, but Ahmed is the father of one of my students.
Less than one month ago, he and his daughter went on from <unk> to his village, and literally <unk> from being killed by a bomb on the way, for minutes.
When you get to your house, they are the phone, a voice would pick up that if he kept sending his daughter to school, they would go back to try.
<unk> now, if <unk> said, "but I won't harm the future of my daughter for your old daughter and <unk> ideas."
What I've been aware of in Afghanistan, and it's something that is often forgotten in the West, is that behind most people -- there's a father who recognized the value of his daughter and it sees that success of her own success.
It doesn't mean that our mothers have not been key to our success.
In fact, they are very often the first <unk> compelling future of their daughters, but in the context of a society like Afghanistan, we need the support of men.
Under <unk> the girls who went to school are in <unk> remember, it was illegal.
But today, over three million girls go to school in Afghanistan.
Afghanistan looks so different from here in the U.S.
I find that Americans see the fragility of changes.
I fear that these changes didn't get a lot, after the retirement of the U.S.
But when I go back to Afghanistan, when I see students in my school and their parents who are going to come up with them, I see a <unk> future and a <unk>
For me, Afghanistan is a country of hope and possibilities -- and every day girls in <unk> I would get it.
Like me, they dream big.
Thank you.
never, ever forgotten the words of my grandmother who died in the <unk> <unk> resists <unk> against him.
But you never go back to a revolutionary <unk>
They've spent almost two years since the <unk> revolution was inspired by the <unk> of mass <unk> so much of the <unk> revolution as the <unk>
A forces with many other citizens <unk> within and outside of the country to call a day of anger and initiate a revolution against the <unk> regime of <unk>
And the <unk> was a great revolution.
Women and young men were at the <unk> edge, the fall of the regime, the decline of freedom, dignity and social justice.
You have shown a courage to face the brutal dictatorship <unk>
They've shown a great sense of solidarity from the Middle East, to the west, to the south.
Finally, after a six months of six months of brutal war and some losses from about 50,000 dead, we managed to release our country and overthrowing the <unk>
However, <unk> left a heavy heavy legacy of <unk> corruption and <unk>
For four decades, the <unk> regime of <unk> destroyed the infrastructure, the culture and the moral structure of the society.
<unk> of the devastation and the challenges, I have loved the devastation of many other women, rebuild civil society <unk> <unk> a inclusive and fair transition to democracy and national reconciliation and national reconciliation.
There were approximately 200 organizations in <unk> <unk> and immediately after the <unk> about 300 to <unk>
After a period of 33 years of exile, I went back to Libya and with a single enthusiasm -- I began to organize workshops on the development of capacities and skills of leadership.
With an incredible group of women, we founded the <unk> of Women <unk> <unk> <unk> movement for the Peace -- a movement of women leaders, the <unk> of the woman and on our own state of participation <unk> in building democracy and peace.
I found myself with a very difficult environment in the <unk> period, an environment that was increasingly <unk> which is <unk> of selfish policies of domination and exclusion.
Over time, our initiative was successful and successful.
The women won a <unk> of the National Congress in the first elections in 52 years.
However, a little bit, the exhilaration of elections and revolution as a whole, were <unk> every day of violence.
One day we wake up with the news of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
Another day <unk> the news of the murder of the American ambassador and the heart attack.
Another day we wake up with the news of the U.S. officials of the army.
And every day, each day we woke up with the government of the <unk> and their mortal rapes of human rights from prisoners and their lack of respect of law.
Our society, made up by a <unk> mentality -- and has been away from the ideals and the principles of freedom, dignity, social justice, social justice, that we had at the beginning.
<unk> and <unk> became the icons of the consequences of revolution.
I'm not here at all about <unk> with our story about the success of the <unk> <unk> and the elections.
And I am here today to say that we, as a nation, we choose badly, we take the wrong decision.
We don't prioritize well.
Because elections didn't brought peace and stability and safety to Libya.
<unk> list and <unk> and <unk> brought peace and reconciliation.
No, they didn't.
What happened then?
Why is our society still <unk> and dominated with selfish policies of domination and <unk> both for men like <unk>
Perhaps what was missing wasn't only women, but the feminine values of compassion, <unk> and <unk>
Our society needs the national dialogue and the creation of consensus more than the choices needed to be the <unk> and the <unk>
Our nation needs the average depiction of the female which is the most likely to need the representation of <unk> and quantitative representation of it.
We need to stop acting as agents and call days of anger.
We need to start acting as agents of compassion and mercy.
We have to develop a female speech that not only <unk> but it will also be <unk> in practice <unk> instead of <unk> the collaboration instead of competition, <unk> instead of getting involved.
These are the ideals that a Libya, <unk> Libya, desperately desperately -- the end of achieving peace.
Because peace has an expectation that comes to the interrelationship and <unk> between female perspectives and male perspectives.
That's the real <unk>
We need to make that in an existential way before we do it <unk>
According to a <unk> of the Koran <unk> <unk> "is the word of the God <unk> <unk> <unk>
At the same time, the word <unk> which is known in all the traditions of <unk> it has the same root in Arabic that the word <unk> <unk> and <unk> which involves all of humanity that men and women, which all tribes and all the towns and all the towns and all the peoples of all of the villages have changed.
And so just like the uterus covers completely the <unk> that grows inside, the divine matrix of compassion -- all the existence.
This is what he says, "My <unk> it covers all the things."
This is what he says, "My <unk> <unk> on my <unk>
That all of them is telling them the grace of mercy.
Thank you.
I'm here today to talk to you about a recent question that has an equally <unk> response.
It's about the secrets of domestic violence, and the question I'm going to deal with is that everybody makes all the usual <unk> Why is she left?
Why was anyone going to stay with a man who was <unk>
I'm not a psychiatrist, nor a social worker, no expert in domestic violence.
I'm just a woman with a story to tell.
I was 22 years old. I was just at Harvard University.
I had moved to New York to my first work as a writer and editor at <unk> magazine.
I had my first apartment, my first green <unk> American <unk> and he had a very big secret.
My secret was that many, many times, the man, that I believed my soul <unk> I would wake up with a <unk> loaded with bullets from <unk>
The man who loved anyone in this world, put a gun in my head and <unk> with <unk> more times than I can remember.
I'm here to tell you the story of <unk> <unk> a psychological trap in love, where every year -- millions of women, and even some men.
It could even be his story.
I don't look like a typical survivor of domestic violence.
I'm a <unk> in Harvard University and I have an MBA at <unk> from the Business Business <unk>
I've spent most of my career working for companies from the list -- <unk> <unk> among them Johnson & Johnson, Leo <unk> and The Washington Washington one.
I'm almost 20 years old, married my second husband and we have three children.
My dog is a black <unk> and lead a <unk> <unk> <unk>
So my first message for you is that domestic violence can happen to anyone, all of the race, all the religions, all income levels and education.
It's all over the place.
And my second message is that everybody thinks that domestic violence happens to women, which is a problem of women.
Not exactly.
More than 85 percent of the <unk> are men, and domestic abuse only happens in <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk> relationships only happens in <unk> <unk> and <unk> in the families, the last place we would want or we would expect to find <unk> for which, domestic abuse is so <unk>
I would have told you that it would be the last person in the world that would be stuck with a man who sticks, and I actually went a very typical victim because of my age.
I was 22 years old, and in the United States in between 16 and 24 years, they have three times more likely to be victims of domestic violence than the other ages, and over 500 women and girls of that age are killed every year by couples, <unk> and husbands in the United States.
I was also a typical victim because I didn't know anything about domestic violence, their warning signs or their patterns.
I met <unk> on a cold cold and Sunday night.
I was sitting next to the subway in New York and started <unk> me.
He said two things.
The first one was that he had just been <unk> from a university of <unk> <unk> and I was working on a very important bank of Wall Street.
But the thing that struck me in that first encounter was that it was ready and fun, and that seemed like a guy in the field.
I had a few big <unk> like apples, and a wheat, <unk> wheat, and it seemed so sweet.
One of the smartest things that made <unk> from the beginning, was to create the illusion that I was the dominant component of the partner.
He did it on the beginning, <unk> in a <unk>
We started getting out and loved everything from me -- that I was ready to Harvard, he had gone to Harvard, he had been to help teenage girls and my work.
I wanted to know all about my family, my childhood, my dreams and illusions.
<unk> believed in me, as a writer and as a woman, as no one had ever done it.
And it was why it was at that <unk> school and work on Wall Street and his brilliant future had so much relevance to it.
I didn't know that the first phase in any relationship of domestic violence is <unk> and <unk> to the victim.
And I didn't know the second step is <unk>
Now, the last thing I wanted to do was I went from New York and leaving my dreams, but I thought I'd do sacrifices for your partner, so I <unk> left my work and <unk> and I went from Manhattan.
I had no idea that I was falling into a <unk> <unk> which was entering a head in a physical <unk> financial and psychological <unk>
The next step in the pattern of domestic violence is to introduce the threat to the violence to see how it react it.
And here is where those <unk> go in.
And as soon as we moved to New England you know, that place where I was supposed to feel so safe I bought three <unk>
One had on the car.
Another he kept it underneath the pillow in our bed and the third always in his pocket.
And he said that I needed those guns to cause the trauma to live in a small life.
I needed them to feel secure.
But those guns were actually a message for me, and even though I had never lifted my hand, my life was really serious danger, every minute of every day.
The first <unk> physical attack happened five days before our wedding.
They were seven in the morning and I still had the <unk>
Five days later, when the 10 bruises were <unk> I put my girlfriend suit, and I married him.
In spite of what had happened, I was sure that we lived happy forever, because I loved him and he also wanted me a lot.
And I was very, very <unk>
There was just felt very <unk> for the wedding and a family with me.
There was a unique accident, and I would never make it hurt.
I spent twice in our <unk>
And the first time I was driving into a secret beach and I got married, and he gave me so strong in my head that I had a number of times against the <unk> of the car.
And then a couple of days later, driving back on our honey moon, went through the traffic and threw me a Big Mac cold to the face.
They were going to go on to <unk> one or twice a week for the next two and a half years of our marriage.
I was <unk> when I thought it was the only one in this situation.
One of three American women is a victim of domestic violence or <unk> at some point of their life, and the Center for Disease Control reports that every year 15 million children are <unk> 15 million.
So, actually, I had very good company.
Going back to my question: Why did I get <unk>
The answer is simple.
I didn't know he was abusing me.
Instead, I was a very strong woman in love with a profoundly <unk> man who was the only person in the world who could help <unk> to face their <unk>
The other question everybody does is: Why don't you just get <unk>
Why don't I get <unk> I could have gone at any time.
For me, this is the saddest and painful question that people do because we give us the victims, we know something that normally you are <unk> is incredibly dangerous to leave a <unk>
Because the last phase in the pattern of domestic violence is to kill her.
More than 70 percent of the killings in domestic violence occur after the victim has end to the relationship, after <unk> because then the <unk> has nothing to lose.
Other implications include permanent desire, even after the <unk> has gone back to marry, and financial resources <unk> to the victim and their children, who normally are forced for judges to spend not <unk> with the man who <unk> his mother.
And we still continue to ask why it just doesn't go?
I was able to go to the cause of one last <unk> beating my denial.
I realized that the man who loved so much would have killed me if it would have allowed.
So I broke the silence.
I told you all the world -- to the police, my neighbors, my friends and family, all unknown, and I'm here today because all of you are <unk>
We have the tendency to <unk> victims of the victims as <unk> <unk> women, <unk> goods.
The question, "Why is it <unk>
For some people, it's a way to say <unk> is <unk> as if the <unk> victims were intentionally <unk> of men who want to <unk>
But since I published <unk> <unk> I've heard hundreds of stories of men and women who have learned that they learned a <unk> lesson from what happened to you, and they would bring their lives together joyful and happy people like <unk> wives and mothers, completely free of violence, like mine.
Because it turns out that I'm actually a victim and a survivor of domestic domestic violence.
I went back to marry a man and cute man and we have those three children.
I have that black <unk> and also that <unk>
What I'm not going to have ever more, would ever be a <unk> <unk> pointing to my head in the hands of someone who says I will.
At this point, you are thinking, <unk> that's <unk> or <unk> which is <unk> or <unk> which is <unk> but all this time I've actually been talking about you.
I assure you that there are a few people that are listening to me right now, which are being <unk> or they were being <unk> or they were <unk> themselves.
The abuse could be affecting his daughter, his sister, her best friend right now.
I was able to end my crazy love crazy love breaking silence.
And I keep doing it today.
It's my way to help other victims, and it's my last request for you.
Talk about what you've heard here.
Sex abuse only in silence.
They have the power to end domestic violence by simply throwing light on it.
The victims we need all the world.
We need each to understand the secrets of domestic violence.
Take the abuse on the light on the light by talking about it with their children, their coworkers and family and family.
<unk> their vision of survivors like fantastic people and <unk> who have a future <unk>
You know, the simple signs of violence in order to intervene consciously, to stop their climb and show the victims a safe <unk>
Together, we can turn our beds, our tables and our families in the oasis and <unk> they should be.
Thank you.
Hi. I call it Cameron <unk> and since a while, I'm a model.
In order for 10 years ago.
And I feel that at this moment there is a awkward tension in the room because it shouldn't have been dressed in the room like this.  Luckily, I brought clothes to <unk>
This is the first change of clothing on a stage of <unk> so you have a lot of kind of <unk> I think.
If some of the women were <unk> when they <unk> they don't have to be <unk> now, but I'll find it later on Twitter.
I also want to point out that I have the privilege of being able to change what you think about me in just 10 seconds.
Not everybody has that opportunity.
These heels. These are very <unk> less bad than I don't have to use them.
The worst part is going to be this sweater, for your head, because it's when they're going to laugh at me, so you don't do anything while I cover my head.
All right.
Why do I do this?
It's been embarrassing.
Well, I hope not as much as this picture.
<unk> is powerful, but also <unk>
I've changed totally what they thought about me in six seconds.
And in this picture, I had never had a boyfriend in real life.
I was totally uncomfortable and the photographer told me that he was going to go back and get the back of the kid.
Of course, with surgery or an artificial tan like which I did two days ago for work, there are very little that we can do to transform our looks, which, even though superficial and <unk> it has a huge impact on our lives.
So today, to me, being brave means being honest.
I'm on this stage because I'm a model.
Because I am a nice, white woman, and in my workforce, that's being a sexy girl.
I'm going to answer the questions that people always ask me, but <unk>
The first question is, how do you get to be model?
And I always say, <unk> <unk> I was discovered, but that doesn't mean anything.
The real reason I made myself model is because I won the genetic lottery. And I'm the <unk> of an <unk> and maybe you're wondering what this <unk>
Well, in the last centuries we haven't only defined beauty as health, youth and symmetry, which we are biologically programmed to <unk> we've also associated with a high and <unk> shape to the <unk> and a white skin.
And that's my <unk> <unk> that I have known to harness to make money.
And I know that there are people in the audience who are now shown <unk> and maybe there are some <unk> in fashion that <unk> <unk> There are <unk> Joan <unk> <unk> <unk>
First of all, we would find them so much about models.
But unfortunately I have to report that in 2007, a Ph.D. student from the University of New York told all of the models in the <unk> and the <unk> models -- just <unk> -- that is less than four percent, they were not white.
The next question that people always ask me is, can it be a model when it's <unk>
And my first answer is: I don't know, I don't care about that.
But then, what I would really tell you about every one of these girls is: Why? Can you be what you want.
You can be president of the United States, or the <unk> of the next Internet, or a surgeon <unk> <unk> and poet, which would be awesome, because you're the first.
If after this spectacular list, I still <unk> No, no, <unk> I want to be a model, then I say, "I know my <unk>
Because I'm not in charge of anything, and you could be the <unk> head of American <unk> or the executive executive of <unk> or the next Steven <unk>
Saying you want to be a model to say you want to win the lottery when you're larger.
It's out of your control, it's amazing, and it's not a work that you can choose.
I'm going to show you everything I learned in 10 years as a model, because, unlike <unk> surgery can be summarized right now.
I don't know what happened there.
Unfortunately, once you've been able to take your studies, and you have a sample and some work on your backs, no matter what you <unk> I mean, if you want to be president of the United States, but you remember your sample of inner clothes for 10 years, people would look at you.
The next question that people always do is if all of the pictures were <unk>
And yes, you pretty much <unk> all the pictures, but that's just a small part of what happens.
This was the first picture that I was told, and also the first time I used a <unk> and I didn't even have my <unk>
I know we're going into the personal field, but it was a little girl.
This was this <unk> to my grandmother a few months earlier.
These two pictures are from the same day.
My friend came with me.
Here I am at a <unk> party a few days before photos for French <unk>
Here I am with my football team and in the magazine.
And this is me today.
And I hope you'll realize that I'm not myself in those photos.
They are <unk> from a group of professionals, <unk> <unk> photographers and <unk> and all of their <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and they get to create this. That's not me.
Well, the next question that people always ask me is to do things for free?
I have too many heels. And I never use, except the couple before, but the privilege I get is the ones I get in real life, and that we don't like to speak.
I grew up in Cambridge, and I went to a shop and I forgot to take money, and I was given the dress for free.
When I was a teenager, I was traveling with my friend who was a <unk> <unk> and he jumped on a red light and of course, and we were <unk> and <unk> and <unk> to be able to keep <unk>
I think of these privileges by my respect, not for what I'm am. And there are people who are paying a price for their way no matter who they are.
I live in New York, and last year, from the <unk> teenagers who stood up and <unk> 86 percent were black and <unk> and most of them were young men.
And there are only <unk> young black and Latino men in New York, so for them, not a question of <unk>
How many times do I get <unk>
By doing research for this talk, I learned that at 53 percent of the <unk> girls in the United States don't like their body, and that figure comes to 78 percent to the 17.
So, the last question that people ask me is: How is life of an model?
And I think the answer that you expect is: If you're a little thinner and you have the most brilliant hair, you will feel very happy and I'm beautiful.
And behind the cameras, we give an answer that maybe this is going to be <unk>
<unk> It's really wonderful to travel, and also incredible to work with creative people and clever people.
And that's all true, but it's just a part of what happens, because what we never say in front of the cameras, what I never said in front of them, is: I'm insecure.
And I'm because I have to worry about my way every day.
And if you ever ask yourself, with some more thin legs and the most bright hair and it will be happy?
They just have to gather with a group of models, because they have the most <unk> legs the shortest hair and the <unk> but probably are the most insecure women in the planet.
But mostly it was hard to look at a situation of racial oppression and gender when I am one of the biggest <unk>
If there's something that I have to retain from this talk, I hope that everybody is more comfortable to recognize the power of the image in the perception that we have success and failure.
Thank you.
Photography has been my passion since I was good enough to support a camera, but today I want to share with you my 15 pictures more <unk> and I didn't get myself who the <unk>
There were no <unk> no <unk> no chance to repeat the photos, not even a little bit of <unk> in light.
In fact, most of them took them tourists at random.
My story begins in the city of New York to give a <unk> my wife pulled me up this photo holding my daughter on her first birthday. That's the corner of <unk> and 5.
He happened that we went back to New York just one year later, so we decided to take the same picture.
Well, you can imagine what comes now.
When my daughter was approaching my daughter, my wife told me, why don't you take you <unk> New York on a <unk> journey, and you follow the <unk>
So here is when we start to ask the tourists that they were going to leave you with the picture.
It's amazing that the gesture of delivering the camera to a whole stranger is so universal.
No one has ever been denied and fortunately, no one has been done with the camera.
So we weren't aware of how much it would change this journey.
It became something sacred for us.
This picture is a few weeks after the <unk> and I had to explain to my daughter what had happened that day that day that a five-year-old could understand.
These pictures are much more than a concrete moment or a specific journey.
They're also a way to stop time in a week of October and to make thinking about our time and evolution over the years, and not only on the physical level, but in all the senses.
Because, even though we always took the same picture, our perspective changes, my daughter reaches new <unk> and I can see life through your eyes and how it perceives it with everything.
That particular time in concrete that we spend together is something that we hope with illusion all the year.
Recently, in one of travel, we were walking around, when he suddenly stopped in my tracks and pointed out a red <unk> of the pirate shop that <unk> little <unk>
And he described to me that I felt at five years of foot in that same place.
<unk> who remembered his heart <unk> with the strength of the first time nine years ago.
And now what you look at in New York is universities, because it's determined to study in New York.
And suddenly I understood that one of the most important things we created are memories.
So I want to share the idea of actively engaging in the conscious creation of memories.
I don't know about you, but apart from these 15 pictures, I don't go out in many of the family pictures.
I'm always the one that comes out of the picture.
Today I want to encourage everybody to appear in the picture, and you don't want to get it to somebody and ask him, you get a <unk>
Thank you.
I'd like to talk about a very special group of animals.
There are 10,000 species of birds in the world.
<unk> are found in the most <unk> group.
First of all, why do you have so bad <unk>
It's also been associated with Disney laughs, and they'd be stupid and silly characters.
More recently, if you've been following the press -- laughs, applause, and <unk> these are the attributes that they associate with Parliament <unk> but I don't accept it.
I don't accept it. You know why?
Because the members of Parliament don't keep the environment.  <unk> don't help prevent the spread of disease.
<unk> are <unk>   And my favorite, the <unk> have better presence.   And there are two types of <unk> on this planet.
There's the <unk> of the New World who are primarily found in <unk> as the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> <unk> where we have 16 species of species of these 16, 11 people face a high risk of extinction.
So why are the <unk> are important, first of all, provide life ecological services by <unk>
It's our <unk> <unk>
It <unk> the carcasses to the bone.
They help to kill all the bacteria. They will absorb the anthrax that will not be for them and causing huge loss of livestock and disease in other animals.
Recent studies have shown that in areas where there are no <unk> people take three times more time in <unk> and this has huge ramifications in the spread of diseases.
<unk> also have a huge historic importance.
They've been associated with ancient <unk> culture.
<unk> was the symbol of protective and maternity and, along with the <unk> <unk> the unit between High and <unk>
In the mythology <unk> <unk> was the god <unk> and risked his life to save the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk>
In <unk> culture, they are doing very important <unk> to open sky in places like Tibet, there is no place to bury the dead or wood to <unk> so these <unk> provide a natural resource system.
What is the problem with <unk>
We have eight species of <unk> in Kenya, which six are at extreme <unk> of extinction.
The reason is that they're being <unk> and the reason that they're being <unk> is because there are conflicts between humans and <unk> <unk> communities use this poison against predators, and as a consequence, the <unk> are victims of this.
In South Asia, in countries like India and Pakistan, four species of <unk> are on the critical list of <unk> which means that in less than 10 or 15 years old, and the reason is because they fall prey from the consumer consumption that has been treated with a <unk> drug.
This drug has been banned for veterinary <unk> in India and have taken a posture.
Since there is no <unk> there has been a spread in the number of <unk> dogs in <unk> of <unk> and when you have dogs <unk> you have a huge time bomb to <unk> the number of cases of rage has increased enormously in India.
Kenya is going to have one of the biggest wind farms in Africa, <unk> <unk> are going to be above Lake <unk>
I'm not against wind, but we have to work with governments, because wind turbines do this to birds.
They're <unk> of birds.
In West Africa, there is a horrific trade of <unk> dead to serve <unk> and market <unk>
So what are you doing? Well, we're investigating these birds. We're <unk> <unk>
We're trying to determine its basic ecology and see where they go.
We can see that they travel through different countries, so to focus on a social problem is not going to be done at all.
We have to work with governments at the <unk> levels.
We're working with local communities.
We're talking to them about appreciating the <unk> on the need to appreciate these wonderful creatures and services that we make.
How can you help? It can become active to make noise. You can write a letter to your government and tell you that we have to focus on these very <unk> creatures. They have their time to spread the word.
When you go out of this room, I will tell you about the <unk> but they talk to their families, with their children, with their neighbors about the <unk>
They are very <unk> Charles Darwin said he changed because he saw them by flying without effort, no energy spending in the heavens.
Kenya, this world, will be much poorer without these wonderful species.
Thank you very much.
Every single thing I do -- and everything I do -- my life has been <unk> for seven years of work in Africa.
From <unk> to 1977. I was a young man, but I'm not.  I worked in Zambia, Kenya, Costa <unk> Costa <unk> and Somalia.
I worked for an NGO <unk> and every project that we set up in sub-Saharan Africa.
And I was <unk>
I went back to the 21, that Italians were good people, and we were doing a good job in Africa.
Instead of that, everything you would say to do it.
Our first project, which inspired my first book, <unk> <unk> was a project where a few Italians decided to teach people about Zambia to grow food.
So we got the seeds -- <unk> south of Zambia to this absolutely magnificent valley that descends into the <unk> River, and we teach the local local citizens to grow tomatoes and <unk> and <unk>
And of course, people weren't at all interested in doing that, so they were telling them to come to work, and so sometimes they were not going to come to work, and sometimes they were not <unk>  We were just aware that the locals in so fertile valley, they hadn't had agriculture.
However, instead of asking you how it was possible that we didn't know -- anything, we just said, "Thank God we are here --  <unk> in time to save the people in Zambia.
And of course, everything in Africa was grown <unk>
We got these magnificent <unk> in Italy, a tomato tomato in Italy, and it would grow this size.
And we couldn't believe it, we were telling the <unk> "Look how easy the <unk>
When tomatoes were <unk> <unk> and red and <unk> at the morning, about 200 <unk> appeared from the river and ate it.  And we said to the <unk> "Oh my God, the <unk>
And the <unk> said, "Yes, that's why we don't have agriculture here."  "Why don't you get it, "You're never <unk>
I thought of only the Italians to <unk> errors in Africa, but then, I saw what the American did, what they were doing, what they were doing, and after seeing what they were doing, I felt pretty proud of our project in Zambia.
Because, as you can see, at least we feed the <unk>
So let's look at the <unk>  <unk> seeing the waste that we gave them to the <unk> people in Africa.
She wants to read a book, read <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
The book was published in 2009.
We, Western donors have given the African continent two million dollars in the last 50 years.
I don't tell you about the damage that the money has <unk>
Just read your book.
It's a part of an African woman, the damage that we've done.
The Westerners are <unk> missionaries and we treat people just from two ways: or <unk> or <unk>
The two words come from the Latin root <unk> which means <unk>
However, it means two different things.
<unk> I treat any of a different culture as if they were my kids, I want you too much.
<unk> I'm trying to do all of a different culture as if they were my <unk>
So the white in Africa are called <unk> <unk>
That book gave me a slap in the face -- "The <unk> is <unk> written by <unk> who said for all economic development, if people don't want to be <unk> <unk> alone.
This should be the first principle of aid.
The first principle of aid is <unk>
This morning, the gentleman who opened this conference, put a cane on the ground and said, we can -- you can -- you can imagine a city that's not <unk>
I decided to answer the people, and I invented a system called <unk> <unk> where you never start anything, you will ever motivates anyone, but it becomes a <unk> of local passion -- the <unk> of the local people who have sleep to become a better person.
So what do you do? <unk>
You never get to a community with an idea, and you sit with the people of the <unk>
We don't work from the offices.
We got together in a coffee. We got together in a pub.
We have zero infrastructure.
And what do we do? We become friends, and we found what the person wants to do.
The most important thing is passion.
You can give you an idea to someone.
If that person doesn't want to do that, what are you going to do it?
The passion that she has for its own growth is the most important thing.
The passion that that man has for their own personal growth is the most important thing.
And then we help them find the knowledge because nobody in the world can be successful alone.
The person with the idea may not have the knowledge, but knowledge is available.
So years and years ago, I had this idea: Why not we, for once instead of getting to a community to tell people what to do, why not, for once, but not in <unk> meetings.
Let me tell you a secret.
There's a problem with <unk> meetings.
<unk> never <unk> and they will never tell you in a public meeting, what they want to do with their own money, what a chance has identified.
So the planning has this blind point.
The smartest people in their community, you don't even know them, because they don't address their public meetings.
What do we do? We work one to one, and we work face to face, you have to create a social infrastructure, which doesn't exist.
You should create a new business.
The profession is the family doctor of the company, the family doctor of the business, who sets up with you in your house at the table in his kitchen table, and it helps to find the resources to transform his passion in a form of a living.
I started this as a test in Western Australia City.
I was doing a Ph.D. in the time, trying to move away from this junk garbage where we got to tell you what to do.
In one year, I had 27 projects on, and the government came to me to see to ask, "How can you do that?
How do you do it?" And I said, "I did something really, really difficult.
And so --   So the government says, <unk> back.  We've done it in 300 communities in the world.
We've helped start 40,000 businesses.
There is a new generation of entrepreneurs who are dying of loneliness.
Peter <unk> one of the most extraordinary business advisers in history, passed the '96, a few years ago.
Peter <unk> was a philosophy professor before getting involved in business, and this is what Peter <unk> said, "The planning is actually incompatible with a society and a company of company <unk>
The planning is the kiss of the death of business dead.
So now <unk> rebuilding <unk> without knowing what people most <unk> in <unk> want to do with their own money and their own energy.
You have to learn how to get these people to talk to you with you.
You have to offer them <unk> privacy, it has to be fantastic to the patient, and then they will come up, will come into mass.
In a community of 10,000 people, we got 200 customers.
Can you imagine a community of 400,000 people, intelligence and passion?
What do you talk about -- you know, this tomorrow?
Local <unk> That's what you have <unk>
So what I tell you is that the spirit spirit is where it is.
We're at the end of the first industrial revolution -- fossil revolution -- fossils not renewable <unk> and one moment to another, we have systems that are not sustainable.
The internal combustion engine is not sustainable.
<unk> as a way of holding <unk> is not sustainable.
What we have to consider, is how to <unk> <unk> <unk> communicate to seven billion people, in a sustainable way.
There are no technologies to do it.
Who is going to invent the technology for the green revolution, <unk> <unk>
The government?
They will be entrepreneurs and they're doing it now.
There is a particular story that in a <unk> journal many, many years ago.
There was a group of experts who were invited to debate the future of New York City in the year <unk>
And in the year, I got together this group of people, and <unk> about what would happen to the city of New York in 100 years, and the conclusion was <unk> New York City would not have existed within 100 years.
Why? Because they looked at the curve and <unk> if the population keeps growing up to this <unk> to move to the population of New York to the <unk> <unk> six million horses, and the manure produced by six million horses would be impossible to address.
They were already <unk> <unk>  So in <unk> they were <unk> this dirty technology that we would put in New York City.
So what happens? In the next 40 years, in 1900, in the United States appeared -- <unk> generic companies, <unk>
The idea of finding a different technology was absolutely <unk> and there were very few <unk> factories in <unk> places.
<unk> Michigan. Henry Ford.
However, there is a secret to work with the entrepreneurs.
First, you have to offer them <unk>
Otherwise, they won't come to conversation with you.
Then, you have to offer you an absolute <unk> <unk>
And then I will have to tell you the truth about <unk>
The smallest company, the largest company has to be able to do three things <unk> the product you want to sell has to be fantastic, you have to tell with a fantastic marketing -- you have to tell you with a fantastic financial administration
Guess what?
We've never met a single human being in the world that can be done, sell and look for the money itself.
It doesn't exist.
This is not yet born.
We've looked at the <unk> and looked at the 100 companies in the world -- <unk> <unk> -- all the new companies, Google, <unk>
There's only one thing that all of the successful companies in the world have in common, just one: none of them started by one person.
Never the word <unk> but the word <unk> 32 times.
He wasn't just when he began.
Nobody begins a company itself.
So we can create the community where we have <unk> who come from a small business environment <unk> on bars along with their dedicated passwords, and those who are going to do for you, what somebody did for you, what someone did by you, what somebody did for you, what somebody did by this <unk> somebody who is going to ask you, what does it need?
What can you? Can you do it?
Well, you can <unk> you can look for the <unk>
"Oh, no, I can't do that." Tell you <unk>
We activate communities.
Thank you.
Those around us can help us in many ways to improve our lives.
We don't know all the neighbors, so we don't take a lot of knowledge in spite of sharing the same public spaces.
In the last few years, I've tried to share more with my neighbors in the public space, with simple tools like <unk> and templates and chalk.
These projects came from questions like, how much pay my neighbors for their <unk>
How can we pay and borrow more things without calling the door at a bad time?
How do we share more memories of our abandoned buildings and better understand our <unk>
How do we share more our hopes for the empty stores so that our communities can reflect our needs and <unk>
I live in New York, and I'm in love with New <unk>
My soul always finds relief with giant <unk> that give shadow to <unk> <unk> and <unk> for centuries and I trust a city.
It always goes to the music.  There's a <unk> in New York   The city has one of the most beautiful architectures in the world, but also one with the largest <unk> of American properties.
I live around this house, and I thought how it could turn it into a <unk> space for the neighborhood and also in something that changed my life forever.
In 2009, I lost someone who loved a lot.
It was <unk> as a mother to <unk>
His death was sudden and <unk>
I thought a lot about death.
And this made me a profound gratitude for the time living and so on.
He gave the significant things about my current life.
But I went down to keep this look in my daily lives.
It seems to be easy to be able to catch a day and will forget how important for you.
So with the help of old and new friends transformed the wall of this house left off on a giant board and he painted it on her phrases for <unk> "Before she died <unk>
So the <unk> could take a <unk> reflect on their lives and sharing personal aspirations in public space.
I didn't know what to expect this experiment, but the next day the wall was filled and kept <unk>
And I'd like to share some things that people wrote on the wall.
He said, "Before I would die -- I want to be <unk> by <unk>  "Before he died, I want to sit on <unk> on the <unk> line.
I wanted to die for millions of people."
And she wanted to die of a <unk>
He said to die outside the <unk>
And she wanted to die once more."
He said, "Before I want to go to the bailout of <unk>
He said, "Before I was going to be completely myself."
This abandoned space became constructive and the dreams and hopes for people made me laugh at <unk> and they gave me comfort at difficult times.
It's about knowing that you're not alone. It's about understanding our neighbors in new ways and <unk> it is about giving to the reflection of the reflection and the <unk> and remember what the most important thing for us as we grow and <unk>
This happened last year and I started receiving hundreds of messages from <unk> people who wanted to do a wall in their community.
So with my colleagues at the civic center of the civic center, we had a kit, and now they've been done in countries around the world, like Kazakhstan, South Africa, Argentina and beyond.
And together we proved the power of our public spaces if we give ourselves a chance of express ourselves and share each other.
Two of the most valuable things we have is time and our relationships with other people.
In our age of expansion. In our <unk> it is more important than ever, to find the ways of preserving the perspective and remember that life is short and fragile.
The death is something that we often avoid talking about, or even think, but I understood that we were preparing for death to be one of those things that would be more power.
Think about death <unk> our life.
Our shared spaces can reflect better than individuals and as community and more media to share hope, fears and stories, the people around us can't only help improve places, can help improve our lives.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Today, I have a single request.
Please don't tell me I'm normal.
Now I'd like to introduce you to my siblings.
<unk> is 22 and very <unk>
Not speech, but it makes joy better than some of the best speakers.
<unk> knows what love.
It shares <unk> pass what happens.
It's not <unk> You don't look at the color color.
They don't care about religious differences and focus on this: It's never <unk>
When I sing songs from our childhood, trying to tell me the words that I couldn't even get in, it reminds me of one thing: how little we know about the mind and how wonderful it should be the unknown.
Samuel it's 16 years old. It's high. It's very <unk>
<unk> the most <unk> memory.
However, it's a selective memory.
It doesn't remember if I stole my <unk> but it reminds me of the year that came out every single songs of my iPod, conversations that we kept when I was four years old, I would pee on my arm during the first episode of the <unk> and the Lady of Lady <unk>
It doesn't look like that."
But most people don't agree with.
And in fact, because your minds don't fit into the concept of <unk> of society, they're often <unk> and <unk>
But what propelled my heart and <unk> my soul was that even if that was the case, although you wouldn't consider them within the <unk> it could only mean one thing: they were <unk> autistic people.
Now, for those less familiar term -- it's a complex brain disorder that affects social communication, learning and sometimes to the physical skills.
In each individual is embedded in a different way, from there that will be so different from Sam.
And all over the world, every 20 minutes, being diagnosed with a new case of autism, and even though it's one of the development disorders that goes faster in the world, there is no cause no cure.
I don't remember my first encounter with autism, but I don't remember one day without it.
I was only three years when my brother came to the world, and I was very excited to have a new self in my life.
When a few months, I realized that he was different.
<unk> a lot.
I didn't want to play as the other babies, and in fact, it didn't seem very interested in me at all.
<unk> lived and <unk> in their own world, with their own rules, and I found pleasure in the smallest things, like putting the cars in row around the room, looking at the washing machine and eat anything that would have <unk>
As I was growing up, it was getting more different, and the differences were made more evident.
But beyond the <unk> and frustration and hyperactivity was something really <unk> a pure nature of nature, a child who sees the world without <unk> a human being that had never been <unk>
<unk> <unk>
I can't deny that there have been some difficult moments in my family, moments in which I wish they were just like me.
But I look back at things that have taught me about individuality, communication and love, and I realize that they're things that wouldn't want to change the normal.
<unk> happens to high the beauty that give us the differences and the fact of being different doesn't mean that some of them are wrong.
It just means there's a different view of what's right.
If I could get a single thing to <unk> and to Sam and to you, it would be that they don't have to be normal.
They can be extraordinary.
Because, autistic or not, the differences that <unk> are a <unk> Each of us has a gift inside of your inner and honestly, the search for normal is the ultimate <unk>
The opportunity for <unk> progress and change dies at the time that we try to be like others.
Please. Don't tell me I'm normal.
Thank you.
Five years ago, I experienced a little bit of what must have been <unk> in the <unk>
Penn State asked me, a communications teacher who would give a class of communication to students in engineering.
I was scared.  <unk> of real students with their great minds, their big books and their big unknown words.
But when those conversations, I felt what <unk> must have felt when he fell through the hole of the rabbit and saw the door of a new world.
I just felt when I had those conversations with the students, I was surprised the ideas that they had, and I wanted others to experience this wonderful world.
And I think the key to opening that door is a great communication.
We need desperately a great communication of our scientists and engineers in order to change the world.
Our scientists and engineers are the ones who are attacking our biggest challenges and healthcare and health care -- and if we don't know about this, work is not done, and I think it's our responsibility as we don't have these interactions.
But these big conversations can't happen if our scientists and engineers don't invite us to see their wonderful world.
So scientists and engineers, please, <unk>
I want to share some suggestions on how you can do it to make sure that your science is sexy and their engineering is attractive.
First question for us, and then what?
<unk> why is science relevant to us.
Don't tell us that you just study the <unk> but they study the <unk> that are the mesh structure of our bones because it's important to understand and treat <unk>
And when you're describing your science <unk> <unk>
<unk> is a hurdle for our understanding of their ideas.
Sure, you can say <unk> and <unk> but why don't you say <unk> and <unk> which is much more accessible to us?
<unk> accessible is not the same thing as <unk>
Instead, as Einstein, said, everything is as simple as possible, but not simple.
They can clearly communicate their science without engaging the ideas.
One thing to consider is to use examples, stories and analogies are ways of turning them together and <unk> with their content.
And by presenting her work, forget about signs of <unk>
You have wondered why they're called <unk>  What do you do the <unk> <unk> killed and <unk> their presentation.
A <unk> like this is not just boring, but it's supporting too much in the language of our brain and <unk>
Instead, this <unk> example of <unk> Brown is much more effective, it shows that the special structure of the <unk> is so strong that it really inspired the single design of the <unk> <unk>
The trick here is to use a simple <unk> <unk> that the public can understand if you lose a little bit, and then provide graphs that will bring us into our other senses and create a deeper sense of understanding of what they were <unk>
I think these are just a few keys that can help everyone else open the door and look at the country of wonders which is science and engineering.
And so scientists and engineers, when you have solved this equation, for all the media -- <unk> with <unk>  Thank you.
One of my favorite words from all the Oxford English <unk>
Just because it sounds pretty good.
And <unk> means <unk> <unk>
Although there was a <unk> editor, in the 19th century that defined it much better when he said, "A <unk> is the one who looks for a public charge no matter <unk> <unk> and that, when he wins it for the mere use of a monumental <unk>
I have no idea what it means.
Something to do with words, I guess.
It's very important that words are the basis in politics, and that all politicians know that they have to try to dominate the language.
It wasn't <unk> for example, that the British Parliament allowed the newspapers to quote the exact words that were said in the <unk> camera.
And all of this was because of the bravery of a guy with the name of <unk> <unk> who was confronted with <unk>
They put him on the Tower of London, and he was <unk> but he had enough courage to tackle them, and at the end, he had such popular support in London that I won.
And just a few years later, we had the first recorded use of the phrase <unk> <unk> like <unk>
Most people think it's literal to it.
It's not. It's for a advocate of freedom of expression.
But to show you how words and politics interact, I want you to go back to the U.S., right after independence.
So, they had to address the question of how to call George Washington, her leader.
You didn't know.
How do you call the leader of a <unk> country.
This is <unk> in Congress for a long time.
These are all kinds of suggestions that might have <unk>
Some people wanted to call it <unk> <unk> and others, "Your <unk> George <unk> and other <unk> from the United States <unk> <unk>
Not very <unk>
Some of them just wanted to call it <unk>
They thought it was tried quality.
And not even with it was <unk> they had the idea that you could be elected King by a given term.
And there might be <unk>
Everybody got tired of <unk> because this debate was <unk> for three weeks.
And I read the newspaper of a poor <unk> and always <unk> there with this <unk>
Which caused the <unk> and the <unk> was that the House House was against the <unk>
The House of course, did not want to be Washington to be able to become power.
They didn't want to call him what he was like, he would give him a little ideas.
So they wanted to give it the <unk> <unk> more <unk> and more unfortunate than they came up with.
And that title was <unk>
President. I didn't invent the title.
It was like the president of a jury.
And I didn't have much more <unk> than the term <unk> or <unk>
There was a little <unk> of little <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk> of government, but it was really a insignificant.
And so the Senate is <unk>
They said, "is ridiculous, we can't call it <unk>
"This guy has to sign treated and meet with <unk> <unk>
"And who would take a serious title with a <unk> <unk> <unk>
And finally, after three weeks of debate, the Senate doesn't exist.
We can learn three interesting things about this.
First of all, and this is my favorite to where I've been able to figure out, the Senate has never <unk> <unk> the title of President.
The President Barack Barack has been lucky to go on there, waiting for the Senate in action.
The second thing that we can learn is that when a government says that a measure is <unk>  <unk> that we keep waiting for <unk> years.
But the third thing we can learn, and this is the most important thing, and this is the most important thing, and this is the title of President of the United States doesn't sound like modest today, right?
Especially if you have more than 5,000 nuclear warheads at disposal, the largest economy of the world and a fleet of flying aerial vehicles and so on.
The reality and the history of the <unk> have misused it.
So at the end, I won the <unk>
<unk> his title of <unk>
And also the other concern about the Senate, the appearance of <unk> well, it was a uniqueness then.
But you know how many nations have now <unk>
And everything because they want to sound like the guy who has the 5,000 nuclear warheads and so on.
So, at the end of the Senate I won and the House of Representatives <unk> because nobody is going to feel humble when you tell them that now is the President of <unk>
And I think that's the big lesson that we can learn, and that I would like to give you a <unk>
politicians are trying to choose and use the words to shape and control the reality, but really, it changes a lot more the words that are that what they could change reality.
Thank you very much.
I'm 45 to <unk> in a illegal mine in Ghana.
The air is charged with heat and dust and it's hard to breathe.
I feel the touch of <unk> bodies in the dark, but I can't see much more.
I hear voices that speak but, above all, that cacophony of male <unk> and stones with primitive.
As everybody else, I take a cheap flashlight of light <unk> strapped onto the head with this <unk> <unk> and I can barely distinguish the branches of that hole in that hole of that hole from a meter that drops hundreds of feet on the ground.
And it was <unk> my hand and suddenly I remember a <unk> I met days earlier, who lost control and dropped <unk>
As I talk to you today, these men are deep at that hole at risk their lives without paying reward and often dying.
I went home from that hole and I went home, but they probably never will.
In the last 28 years, I was documenting native cultures in over 70 countries in six continents, and in 2009, I had the great honor of being the only <unk> in the gender <unk>
Among all the amazing people I met there I met a <unk> <unk> the <unk> an NGO who is dedicated to eradicating modern slavery.
We started talking about slavery and, really, I started learning about slavery because I knew there was the world in the world, but not even like grade.
When we finished talking to me, I was really bad at ignoring this <unk> of our days and I thought, if I don't know, how many people don't know?
I got rid of my stomach and weeks later, I flew to Los Angeles to meet the director of <unk> the <unk> and offer my help.
This is how I started my journey to modern slavery.
Interestingly, I've been in many of these places.
Some of them even considered my second home.
But this time, <unk> <unk> dirty <unk>
A conservative calculation is that there are now over 27 million people in the world.
It's twice the number of African African slaves throughout the whole of slave slave
150 years ago, the cost of a farmer farmer was about three times the annual salary of an American worker.
The equivalent of a <unk> <unk>
However, today you can enslaving entire families for generations for 18 percent <unk>
Amazingly, slavery generates profits from over 13 billion dollars a year around the world.
Many have been <unk> with false aid promises and better work to then find out that they're forced to work without pay, under violence and can't escape.
The slavery today operates in <unk> the goods produced by slaves have value, but those who produce them are disposable ones.
<unk> exists in almost all the world and yet it's illegal around the world.
In India and Nepal, I met the bricks.
This odd and formidable show was how to go into the ancient Egypt or the <unk> of <unk>
<unk> at a temperature in 54 degrees C, men, women, children, in fact, entire families -- <unk> in a heavy <unk> filled in a heavy, mechanically mechanically <unk> <unk> in their head, until 18 at the time, and they take them from the <unk> <unk> to trucks that are hundreds of feet.
<unk> by <unk> and <unk> work in silence, doing this task and again for 16 or 17 hours a day.
There was no coffee to eat, or drink, and severe <unk> made that pee pretty <unk>
So <unk> were the heat and the dust that my camera became too hot to touch and stopped working.
Every 20 minutes I had to run the car to clean up the team and make it work with air conditioning to <unk> and sitting there, I thought, my camera gets a much better treatment than these people.
Back in the '60s I wanted to cry but the <unk> who was on my side quickly grabbed me and said, "You don't want to do it here."
And he explained to me very clearly to demonstrate emotions is very dangerous in places like this, not just for me but for them.
I couldn't offer you any direct aid.
I couldn't give them money, nothing.
I was not citizenship in that country.
I could put them in an worse situation than they were.
I had to rely on the <unk> and the <unk> and working within the system for its release and trusted you in which they did.
As to me, I waited home to feel my heart <unk>
In the Himalayas, I found kids carrying rocks for miles for <unk> <unk> to trucks that were expected to down.
Those big <unk> were more heavy than the kids who would charge and the children would put them on their heads with <unk> <unk> made of <unk> ropes and <unk>
It's hard to see something so <unk>
How can we influence something so <unk> but so <unk>
Some people don't even know they're slaves and they work 16 hours a day without <unk> because this has been this whole life.
They have nothing to do with it?
When these <unk> <unk> their freedom, the <unk> <unk> <unk>
When you hear the word slavery often we think about sexual traffic and because of this global awareness to me that it would be difficult for me to work with security in this particular business.
In <unk> I was <unk> women who had been previously <unk> <unk>
It took me up on a stairs <unk> who gave this <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
It wasn't exactly a <unk>
It was a restaurant.
<unk> as you know in the craft, are local prostitution for forced prostitution,
They have small rooms -- private rooms, where they <unk> them with their girls and children, some of them just seven years -- are forced to entertain customers and <unk> to buy more food and alcohol.
Each shock is dark and <unk> identified by a number painted on the wall and divided by a <unk> and a curtain.
The workers often suffer sexual abuse for their clients.
On the <unk> I remember feeling a sense of <unk> <unk> and in that moment, I could barely imagine what it must be stuck in that hell.
I just had a <unk> the stairs where they were going.
There were no doors.
There were no windows enough for <unk>
Those people don't have <unk> and, because you touch a really hard topic -- it's important to point out that slavery even sexual traffic is going around us.
There are hundreds of <unk> people in agriculture, in the domestic service, and the list can continue.
Recently, the New York Times reported that between 100,000 and 300,000 American children are sold every year as sexual <unk>
It's everywhere, but we don't see it.
<unk> are another activity that often relate to <unk> labor.
I went to Indian villages where there were entire families coming together in the trade.
This is a family.
<unk> hands are the father, the <unk> of blue and the red <unk> of their children.
<unk> <unk> in these big barrels and warm silk in the liquid to the <unk> but <unk> is toxic.
My performer told me about stories.
"We don't have <unk> they said.
We still hope yet to get out of this house someday and go to another place where we really pay our job."
It's estimated that there are over 4,000 children in the <unk> lake <unk> the largest artificial lake in the world.
When we came there, I went to take a quick look fast.
I saw what it seemed to be an fishermen family on a boat, two older brothers -- some more young brothers -- it makes sense not?
<unk> They were all slaves.
Children are separated from their <unk> families and they were forced to work on these boats on these boats on the lake, despite knowing to swim.
This child is eight years old.
When our boat came up to me was <unk> the thing that his little canoe was <unk>
I was paralyzed by the fear of falling into the water.
The <unk> branches of the trees plunged into Lake <unk> often trap networks and children, <unk> and fear, they get the water to unlock the branches.
Many of them are <unk>
Since remember, it's always forced to work in the lake.
For fear of her love not going to flee and like all life has been treated with cruelty, <unk> tries to the youngest slaves under their command.
I met these guys at five in the morning, when they woke up the last networks, but they had been working from one another.
<unk> and <unk>
And it would point out that these networks weigh over 400 pounds when they're packed with fish.
I want to introduce you to <unk>
Kofi was rescued in a village of fishermen.
I met him in a shelter in which the <unk> <unk> to death <unk>
Kofi is as possible.
Who will be because of someone decided to make the difference in your life?
They went on a road in Ghana with partners in <unk> the <unk> a fellow <unk> with his suspected <unk> and <unk> our car and played the window.
It was asked to do it by a way of land to the jungle.
At the end of the way, we were going to get out of the car, and he asked the driver to come out very quickly.
Then he pointed out this path just visible and said, "This is the way, this is the road.
As we started down, we removed the <unk> that <unk> the way and after walking around an hour we found that the path was <unk> by the recent <unk> so I put the pictures of photos on my head as it was <unk> in these waters to my chest.
After two hours of <unk> the <unk> path ended up in a clear, and we had a mass of holes that could fit into a football field, and they were all full of banking workers.
A lot of women had children tied to their backs, and as they were looking for gold, so they were looking for gold, so they were looking for gold, so they were looking for gold, <unk> in <unk>
The <unk> is used in the <unk> process.
These miners are <unk> in a well in another part of Ghana.
When they came out of the pump were <unk> in his own sweat.
I remember looking at his eyes tired, because many had been underground for 72 hours.
The wells have to 90 feet and these people carry up heavy equipment <unk> that then will be transported to another area where we <unk> the stone to get the gold.
And the site seems to be filled with strong men and <unk> but if you look closer at the side of the side, we see to work on others and also children.
They're all victims of injuries, and disease and violence.
In fact, it's very likely that this <unk> will end up like this victim of tuberculosis and <unk> for <unk> in a few years.
This is <unk> When his father died, he took him to work with him in mines.
When they die his uncle, <unk> <unk> the debt of the uncle as a slave in mines.
When I met her, I had worked in the mines 14 years and the injury of the leg that you see here is a product of a crash in the <unk> so severe that doctors said to be <unk>
In addition to that, <unk> has tuberculosis, and yet, it's forced to work night and day in that mine.
Even so, he dream of being liberated and educated with local activists like <unk> the <unk> and this kind of determination, of the face of a remote possibility to a remote possibility.
I want to shine light on slavery.
Did you know that your images would be seen by you all over the world.
I wanted you to know that we will provide testimony to them and to make everything possible to help change their lives.
I really believe that if we can see each other as human beings, then it becomes very difficult tolerate atrocities like slavery.
These images are not science -- they're from people, real people, as you and like me, who deserve the same rights, dignity and respect in their lives.
There's no day to happen that I don't think of these beautiful people, <unk> that I've had the great honor to meet.
I hope these pictures show a force where you see them in people like you, and I hope that that force turn on a fire and that fire <unk> light on slavery because, without that light, the beast of slavery can continue to live in the shadows.
Thank you very much.
I make mathematics applied and there's a peculiar problem for the <unk> we are like <unk>
Nobody knows what the hell we do.
So today, I want to try to explain to you what I do.
<unk> is one of the most human activities.
We were <unk> the <unk> and the dancers of <unk>  that we will see later on.
But <unk> demand for a degree of extraordinary training -- a high level of skill and probably some <unk> <unk> that well can have a genetic component.
Sadly, neurological disorders like Parkinson's disease, destroy this extraordinary ability to do with my friend <unk> <unk> who, at his time, was a <unk> <unk>
Over the last few years has been progress in treatment.
However, there are <unk> million people in the world who are sick, and they have to deal with a weakness <unk> <unk> <unk> and other symptoms of this disease, so we need to be able to detect the disease before it is too late.
We need to be able to measure progress in an objective way, and ultimately, the only way we will know if there's really a cure to be when we have an objective and <unk> and <unk>
But it's frustrating that for Parkinson's and other disorders of the movement are no biological <unk> so they don't serve the blood analysis and the best we have is a neurological <unk>
You have to go to a clinic to do it. It's very, very expensive, and that means that, outside the clinical trials, they never do.
And what if patients could do it at home?
That would save a <unk> trip to the clinic. What if patients could do the exam <unk>
It wouldn't be personal.
By the way, it costs about 300 dollars in the <unk> clinic.
So what I want to tell you about as a result, not conventional to a try, you see, in some sense, at least, all of us are <unk> like my friend <unk> <unk>
This is a video of the vibration of vocal strings.
It shows someone healthy while it emits sounds as a dancers of <unk> we can imagine as a dancers of <unk> because we have to coordinate all of those vocal organs to produce sounds and we all have the needed. The <unk> for example.
And as the <unk> requires an extraordinary level of training.
Let's think of time that leads to a child to learn to speak.
From the sound, we can track the position of the vocal cords as it <unk> and like Parkinson's affects the <unk> also affects the vowels.
On the traces of it down you can see an example of a irregular shake of vocal strings.
We see the same <unk>
Would you shake for weakness and <unk>
The speech becomes more quiet and <unk> after a while, and this is an example of the symptoms.
How do you compare these exams based on the voice with <unk> clinical trials -- well, they're both not <unk>
<unk> is not <unk> both use existing infrastructure.
You don't need to design a whole series of hospitals to do them.
Both are <unk> Well, but also the tests on the voice are not <unk>
I mean, they can be <unk>
They do very quickly, take about 30 seconds as a lot.
They are at minimal cost, and we all know what happens.
When something takes a cost so <unk> it appears to be massive scale.
These are some amazing goals to address.
We can reduce the actual difficulties in the patients.
I wouldn't need to go to the clinic for the <unk> of routine.
With high monitoring we could get goals.
We could do massive <unk> cost for clinical trials and for the first time, <unk> <unk> at a general scale.
We have the opportunity to start looking for the first <unk> of the disease before it's too late.
So when we took the first steps in that sense, we're launching the Women's <unk> Initiative in disease.
Along with <unk> and <unk> we want to register a lot of voices around the world to collect enough data and start to address these goals.
We have local lines for about 750 million people in the world.
<unk> with or without disease, it can call under price and leave for a few cents. And I'm pleased to announce that we've already reached six percent of the goal in only eight hours.
Thank you.   Tom Rielly: So then <unk> by taking all of these samples of, say 10,000 people will be able to say who is healthy and who doesn't?
What are you going to take from these <unk>
Max <unk> Yeah, yeah. What happens is that during the call you have to indicate if you have or not the disease or not the disease. Yeah.
<unk> You see, some people may not be <unk> You may not get it.
But we're going to get a very large sample of <unk> data in different circumstances, and do it in different circumstances is important because we're looking for <unk> the confusion of confusion for the real markers of disease.
TR: Do you have a precision <unk> at this time?
<unk> much more than that.
In fact, my student <unk> I have to do a fantastic job and now has shown that it works on mobile phone network too, which is what we call the project. We have 99 percent accuracy.
TR: <unk> and nine. Well, it's a improvement.
<unk> of course.
TR: Thank you very much. Max <unk>
<unk> Thank you, <unk>
Before March 2011, I was doing <unk> <unk> in New York City.
We're creatures <unk> gray.
We focus on the dark, in rooms without windows and, in general, we avoid sunlight.
We do thin models even more <unk> the perfect skin even more than we do, and we can make it in the press all the time, but some of us are really artists with talent with many years of experience and a real taste for images and photography.
On March 11, 2011, I saw from my house, just like the rest of the world, the <unk> events that were happening in Japan.
Little time later, an organization where it was <unk> where <unk> <unk> was in the place working as part of the answer.
I, along with hundreds of other volunteers we knew we couldn't stay sitting at home, so I decided to join the group for three weeks.
On the 13th of May I traveled to <unk>
It's a little fishing town sitting in the <unk> of almost 50,000 people, one of the first peoples affected by the wave.
The water level recorded it reached over 24 feet tall and over three miles away inside.
As you can imagine, the village was <unk>
We bring rubble from the channels and the <unk>
<unk> schools.
We took tons of tons and tons of fish dead, <unk> from the local factory.
We <unk> and we loved it.
For weeks, both volunteers like the neighbors found similar things.
They found pictures and <unk> photos and cameras and cards.
They all did the same thing.
<unk> and bring them to different places in the peoples of all around them to <unk>
It wasn't until I realized that those pictures made a huge part of personal losses that people had <unk>
As they were <unk> and to save their lives, they had to leave absolutely everything they had.
At the end of my first week, I started to help in a <unk> center of the people.
It helped clean the toilets, gigantic <unk> <unk>
This place turned out to be the place of the village where the center of <unk> <unk> the photos.
And there were the honor that that day <unk> in me to clean up the photos.
This was exciting and inspiring, I had heard about the expression beyond the <unk> but it wasn't until beyond, I was my horizons that something happened.
When you look at the photos, I found some that had over a hundred years old, some of them were still in the face of the lab, and I couldn't avoid thinking about how to fix that <unk> and repair that <unk> and I knew hundreds of people who could do the same thing.
So that night I got on Facebook contacted some of them, and the next morning the answer was so overwhelming and positive and I knew we had to try.
So we started <unk> the photos.
This was the first of all.
I was not too <unk> but where the water had <unk> the face of the girl had to take a lot of precision and <unk>
Otherwise that little girl would not have the aspect of it, and that would be as tragic as I had the picture <unk>
Over the time step of time, they got more photos, and they needed more <unk> this is that I entered Facebook and <unk> and five days later, 80 people from 12 countries volunteered to help.
After two weeks I had 150 people from <unk>
In Japan, in July, we got <unk> to <unk> a neighbor village north of <unk>
Once a week we use our scanner in the libraries of time libraries that had been <unk> where people were going to reclaim their photos.
The time that <unk> in <unk> is a different story, dependent on the <unk> of the photos.
I could engage an hour. I could engage a few weeks.
It could be a few months.
This <unk> had to draw virtually by hand using a guide and the areas whose color and the water was not destroyed.
I took a long time.
The water destroyed all these pictures -- in seawater, covered with algae with algae, and even oil -- all of that with the time step of time I continue to <unk> so it was an important part of the project.
We couldn't afford the picture unless it was clean <unk> and it would have been <unk> by his <unk>
We had luck with the <unk>
So we have a guide from a neighbor neighbor of a remarkable.
It's very easy to harm even more <unk> pictures.
As one time he said, the leader of my group is like making a tattoo.
You can't make mistakes.
The woman who brought us these photos were lucky enough to the photos.
She had started to <unk> her same but stopped when he realized that <unk> even more.
I also had <unk>
Without them, the images of their husband and their own face would not have been <unk> we were able to put the images into a single picture and <unk> the whole picture.
When I picked up their pictures shared some of her story with us.
A few colleagues in her husband found photos on a fire station in a fire station between the rubble quite far away from where he used to be his house, but his colleagues <unk>
The day of the tsunami, her husband was the experimenter to close the barriers to the wave.
It had to go inside the water as the <unk> <unk>
Their children, not so small now, but his two children were at school, in different schools.
One of them was trapped in the water.
He took her a week to find his entire family and know that everyone had survived.
The day I gave his photos his youngest son was 14 years old.
For her, despite all of this, those pictures were the best gift I could tell you, something that he could remember in the past that he could remember from the past that he would remember the past day of March when everything in his life changed or was destroyed.
After six months in Japan 1,100 volunteers had joined up there -- hundreds of them helped us clean up with more <unk> photographs -- the great majority -- the vast majority -- the vast majority of their <unk>
More than 500 volunteers around the world helped us back to 90 families and hundreds of photos fully <unk> and <unk>
During this time, we don't really spend over 1,000 dollars in teams and materials, most of them on ink to <unk>
We take pictures all the time.
One picture is a memory of someone or something, a relationship, someone loved it.
They are <unk> of our memories and stories, the last thing we would take for looking for.
This is what the project is, to restore small pieces of humanity, to return to someone their connection to the past.
When a picture like this, you give someone, a huge difference in the life of the person that comes in.
This project also made a big difference in the life of <unk>
Some of them connected to something larger with something bigger with something bigger by using your talent to something that aren't thin models of perfect skin.
So I would end up to read this email. He sent him Cindy the day I came back from Japan after six months.
While <unk> I couldn't avoid thinking about people and the stories shown in the images.
One particular photo with women from different ages from the grandmother to the young child, <unk> around a baby, <unk> me -- because a picture of my family, my mother, my mother, my mother, and my daughter <unk> hangs out of our wall.
In the whole world, all of our basic needs are the themselves, right?
Thank you.  Thank you.
<unk> <unk> were inspired by awe and curiosity with this picture of a bullet that goes through an apple on an exhibition of just a millionth of a millionth of a second.
But now, 50 years later, we can go a million times faster and see the world not to a million or a billion frames a second.
I present to you a new kind of <unk> the <unk> a new technique that can create videos on slow motion of light in motion.
And with that we can create cameras that can see after the <unk> beyond the line of vision, or seeing the interior of the body without using X-rays, and they challenge the camera idea.
If I take a laser pointer and look at it and look at it in a second or a second or a second or a second, you can create a pack of photons photons -- just one millimeter millimeter millimeter in a row.
And that package of photons -- that <unk> travel at the speed of light, and, again, a million times faster than a common bullet than a common bullet than a common bullet than a common bullet than a common bullet than a common bullet than a common bullet than a common bullet than a common bullet than a common bullet than a common bullet than a common bullet than a
So if we take that bullet and this package of photons and fire in this bottle, how are that lighting photons inside this <unk>
What is the aspect of light in <unk>
Now, all this --   remember, all of this is actually happening in less than a <unk> is what it takes for us to travel the light.
But this video is 10 billion times slower so you can see light in motion.
So Coca-Cola didn't make this research --  <unk> lots of things in this <unk> <unk> this information to show what's going on.
The pulse, our <unk> comes into the bottle with a pack of photons photons that starts <unk> and that, inside, it starts <unk>
Part of the light is <unk> goes to the table, and we start seeing these <unk>
Many of the photons finally come to the cap and then exploit in various directions.
As you can see, there's a air bubble that bounces off the inside.
In that time, the waves travel through the table and because of the insights in the top of the bottle, you see in the bottom of the bottle, after several boxes, that ideas will be <unk>
Now, if we take a common bullet and current bullet and we make it <unk> the same distance and we see it in slow motion.
One day? A week? Actually, a whole year.
It would be a very boring movie --  of a <unk> bullet in motion.
And what about trying to do with <unk> nature.
You can see the waves that are <unk> from the table, the tomato <unk> and the wall.
It's like throwing a stone on a pond.
It's the way nature paints a picture, and I thought about a <unk> at the time, but of course, our eyes see a full composition on it.
But if you look at once more and more of this tomato -- you'll notice that, as the light gets rid of the tomato <unk> it's still bright.
Why? Because the tomato is <unk> and the light is <unk> and the light goes back after several <unk> of a second.
In the future, when this <unk> is in your phone, you're going to be able to go to the supermarket and check whether the fruit is grown without having to touch it.
So what do we create this camera in the <unk>
As photographers, you know, if you take a picture of the <unk> it comes very little light in.
But we're going to go to a billion times faster than the shortest one, so I just get into something of light.
We sent that <unk> that package of photons, millions of times, and we recorded over and over again with a very fancy <unk> we took those data <unk> and the <unk> <unk> to create those <unk> that I showed you.
We can take all of those data into crude and <unk> in a interesting way.
Superman can fly.
Other heroes can become invisible, they can become invisible,
And if a new power of a <unk> future would allow him to see after <unk>
The idea is that we could throw something from light on the door. You can go into the room, a part is going to reflect on the door, and from there to the camera.
Where we could extract those multiple <unk> of light.
It's not science fiction. We already built it.
On the left, it's our <unk>
Behind the wall there is a <unk> and <unk> the light on the door.
After the publication of our article in Nature <unk>
And a fraction of the photons will go back to the camera, but interestingly, slightly different times.
And as we have a camera that works so fast, our <unk> has unique capacities.
It has very good temporary resolution and it can look at the world at the speed of light.
So we know the distances to the door and also even the hidden objects but we don't know what point corresponds to what a distance.
And when you project a laser that can take a picture of a raw, you see on the screen, it really doesn't make any sense.
But we will take a lot of images like this, dozens of images, the <unk> and we're going to try to analyze the multiple <unk> of light, and with that, we'll be able to see the object.
Can we see it in 3D <unk>
This is our reconstruction here.
We have things to explore before you pull this out of the lab, but in the future, we could create cars that <unk> <unk> with what's on the turn of the curve, and so on.
Or we could look for survivors in dangerous conditions by looking at light reflected by open windows here.
Or we could build <unk> able to see the interior of the body through <unk> and the same for the <unk>
But of course, because of the fabric and the blood is pretty difficult, so this is actually a request for scientists to start thinking about <unk> as a new mode of visualization to solve the problems of problems in the next generation.
So as <unk> <unk> He became the science in art, an art of photographs <unk>
I realized that all the <unk> of data that we collected every time are not only for scientific extremists but that we can see.
It will create a new form of computational photograph with slow camera and colors,
And look at those waves -- Remember, the time between each of those waves is just a few <unk> of a second.
But here is also something fun.
If you look at the waves under the <unk> these are leaving us.
The waves should move towards us.
What happens here?
It turns out, as we are recording almost at the speed of light, we have strangers. Einstein would have loved to see this image.
The order that the events happen in the world are sometimes invested in the camera.
We have the corresponding warping of space and time, we can correct this <unk>
That's time. Thank you.
Hi. This is my mobile phone.
A mobile phone can <unk> your life, and give you an individual freedom.
With a mobile phone you can <unk> a crime against humanity in Syria.
With a smartphone you can tweet a message and initiate a protest in Egypt.
With a smartphone you can record a song, <unk> <unk> and make famous.
This is all possible with a mobile phone.
I'm a <unk> of 1984 and I live in the city of <unk>
Let's go back to this time, to this city.
Here you can see the hundreds of thousands of people who are looking for a change.
This is the fall of 1989. Imagine if all of these people who are going to come up and look for a change, had a mobile phone in your pocket.
Who in the room have a cell phone here?
<unk>
Raise your mobile phone, <unk>
<unk> A Android, a Blackberry, clothing.
It's a lot. Almost everybody has a mobile phone.
But today, I talk about my mobile phone, and how I changed my life.
I'm going to talk about this.
These are 35 <unk> lines.
<unk>
Why is that information there?
Because in the summer of 2006 the E.U. Commission presented a <unk>
The <unk> of <unk> <unk>
So this directive says that every European telephone company, every monopoly of the Internet of all Europe, has to store a wide range of information from the users.
Who calls <unk> who sends an email from <unk>
Who sends a text to <unk>
And if we use the mobile phone, where we are.
All of this data is stored for at least six months, and to two years, in your phone company or your Internet monopoly on.
And throughout Europe the people stood up and said, "We don't want to this."
They said they didn't want this password.
We want the <unk> in the digital age, and we don't want the carriers and the Internet providers, all of this information about us.
There was lawyers, <unk> they all said, "We don't want to this."
And here you can see about ten thousand people who came out to the streets of Berlin and said, <unk> not <unk>
And some of them even said that this would be <unk> 2.0.
The <unk> was the secret police of East Africa.
And I also asked if this really works.
Can you store all this information about us?
Every time I use <unk>
So I asked my phone <unk> <unk> <unk> that at that time I was the largest phone company in Germany, and please give me all the information you had about me.
I asked her once, and I went back to ask them, and I didn't get a concrete response. It was all <unk>
But then I said, I want to have this information because you are <unk> my life.
So I decided to give you a court lawsuit because I wanted to have this information.
But <unk> <unk> said no, we'll give you this information.
At the end of the end, he agreed.
They were going to take the demand and they send me the information that I <unk>
Meanwhile, the <unk> Court failed the <unk> for the German law of the E.U.
So I got this ugly thing about brown with a CD inside.
And in the CD there was this.
Thirty and five thousand <unk> 30 lines of information.
At first I saw it, and I said, well, it's a huge file, OK.
But after a while, I realized that it's my life.
There are six months of my life in this archive.
It was a little bit <unk> what should I do with that?
Because you can see where I am, where I step at night, what am I doing.
But then I said, I want this information <unk>
I want to make it public.
Because I want to show people what the retention of data means.
So, along with <unk> <unk> and Open New York, we did this.
This is a visualization of six months of my life.
You can zoom in and go back and go forward.
You can see every step I do.
And you can see how I'm going from <unk> to <unk> and how often I call the way.
This is all possible with this information.
That gives a little scary.
But it's not just me.
It's about all of us.
First of all, there are things like, I call my wife and she's called, we talk a couple of times.
Then they call me some friends and they call each other.
And then you call the other, and the other one, and we end up with this big communication network.
You can see how your people communicate with each other what time they call each other, they call each other, what time you sleep.
You can see all this.
You can see the centers, the leaders of the group.
If you have access to this information, you can see what the society is doing.
If you have access to this information, you can control their society.
This is a model for countries like China and Iran.
This is a model to study the shape of your society, because you know who speaks to whom, who sends him an email from who, all this is possible if you have access to this information.
And this data is stored at least six months in Europe, and to two years.
As I said at the beginning, imagine if all of these people in the streets of Berlin, in the fall of 1989, have a mobile phone in your pocket.
And the <unk> had known who entered this protest, and if the <unk> had known who the leaders, this would never have happened.
The <unk> of the Berlin would never have happened.
And as a result, neither of the <unk> of <unk>
Because today the state agencies and businesses want to store as much information of us as possible in and outside the web.
They want to have the possibility to follow our lives and they want to do it forever.
But the <unk> and living in the digital age is not a contradiction.
But today, you have to fight for the <unk>
You have to fight for that every day.
When you go home and tell their friends that privacy is a value of the 21st century and it's not <unk>
When you go home, tell your representative that just because businesses and state agencies can store some information, they don't have to do it.
And if you don't believe me, ask your phone company, what information store you for.
So in the future, every time you use your mobile phones that you give them to remember that they have to fight for the <unk> in the digital era.
Thank you.
Hello, sure, what happens?
It's not enough.
Hello, sure, what happens?
I call myself <unk> <unk> and I'm not <unk> but I know the doctor that brought me the world.
I took my mom six times in six different directions, <unk> the poor of me in the process.
As a result of a result, I have cerebral palsy, so you will take all the time.
<unk>
It's <unk> I'm like a mixture of <unk>
And Muhammad <unk>
The P. C. It's not genetics.
It's not <unk> it can't be <unk>
No one who was the uterus of my mother and not <unk> because my parents were cousins, though they are.
It's just about accidents, as I was at birth.
Now, I'm going to tell you -- I'm not a source of inspiration -- and I don't want any of you in this room.
It feels bad for me, because at some point of life, they wish to be disabled.
Let's go walk.
<unk> <unk> are in the shopping center, you're driving in a search for parking lot, and what do you see?
16 places for disabled places.
And they think, "God, I can be at least a little bit <unk>
In addition, I have 99 problems, and the P. C. is just one of them.
There was a gold <unk> I would win the gold medal.
I'm a <unk> Muslim woman, and I live in New Jersey.
If you don't feel better, maybe they should do it.
I'm from Park <unk> in New Jersey.
I always loved my neighborhood and my disease had the same first.
I also love that if I wanted to walk from my home to New York, I can do.
A lot of people with cerebral cerebral <unk> but my parents don't believe in the Atkins <unk>
The mantra of my father was, "You can <unk> <unk> <unk>
If my three wonderful sisters <unk>
If my three younger sisters were going to public school, my parents would go to the school system and get sure that I was also out there, and if we didn't take all the ultimate note -- all the <unk> of my mother.
My father taught me how to walk in the age of five years putting my <unk> in his feet and just walking.
Another approach that I used was to hang a dollar in front of me so that they would get it.
The <unk> I carry into was very strong ...
Yeah. The first day in the kindergarten was walking as a hunch champion who has received many taps.
Growing up, there was only six Arabs in my city and were all of the family.
Now there are 20 Arabic now, and they're still all of the family.  I think nobody realized that we weren't <unk>
This was before 9/11 and the politicians would think appropriate to use <unk> to <unk> as a campaign.
The people I grew up with no problems with my faith.
However, it seemed to be a lot of <unk> so much that I died from hunger during the <unk>
I told them that I had enough fat in order to live three months without eating three months without eating the dawn at sunset it's very easy.
<unk> <unk> in <unk>
Yes, in <unk> It's crazy.  My parents couldn't afford physical therapy, so I was sent to school school.
I learned to dance with <unk> or whatever I can walk with <unk>
I'm from New Jersey, and there we want to be <unk> so if my friends were wearing <unk> I too.
And when my friends were going to spend the summer vacation at the coast of Jersey, I was not going.
I spent my summers in a war zone, because my parents were afraid if we wouldn't go back to Palestine all the <unk> we would fall in <unk>
On summer vacation often my father was trying to <unk> so I was drinking milk from <unk> to put me plastic cups on the back, and I remember the water <unk> my eyes and I was like, <unk> <unk>
But the <unk> cure was yoga.
I should say it's very boring, but before doing yoga -- it was a comedian of <unk> that I couldn't stand up with <unk> <unk>
And now I can focus on your head.
My parents gave this idea that I could do anything, that no dream was impossible, and my dream was to be at <unk> Hospital.
I went to college through positive discrimination and I got a scholarship for the <unk> University of the State of Arizona, because it was in all the <unk>
It was like the pet <unk> of the theater department.
I was all <unk>
I made all the tasks of the least smart, I took the ultimate note on my lectures, and also in his classes.
Every time I did a scene from the crystal <unk> my teachers <unk>
But I never got a role.
Finally, in my last year, the <unk> decided to do a piece called <unk> <unk> in <unk>
It's a work of a girl with cerebral <unk>
I was a girl with the cerebral <unk>
So I started screaming at the four <unk> "In order to have a <unk>
I have <unk> <unk>
At the end of it, I <unk>
Thank God <unk> I finally am <unk>
I didn't get the paper.  They gave us <unk> <unk>
I went to <unk> running to the <unk> of the theater, crying as if someone had killed my cat, asking him why and she told me that because they believed that I couldn't do the risk scenes.
And I said, "Excuse me, if I can't do the risk, they can't do the <unk>
It was a paper that literally had been born and gave it to an actor without the cerebral <unk>
The university was imitating my life.
Hollywood has a <unk> story of <unk> <unk> actors for disabled songs.
At the age of school, I went home, and my first tour <unk> was as extra in a <unk>
My dream came true.
And I knew it would be <unk> to <unk> friend <unk> in a <unk>
Instead, I stayed there as a <unk> I didn't look more than the <unk> and it was obvious to me that the <unk> of <unk> don't <unk> actors, <unk> <unk>
It's just going to be perfect people.
But there was exceptions to the rule.
I grew up watching <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and all these women had one thing in common: they were <unk>
So I made myself <unk>
In my first tour, I took comic comics from New York to New Jersey, and I will never forget the face of the first comedian that he took when I was at the realization that it was at high speed on the New Jersey <unk> with a driver that had cerebral <unk>
I worked in clubs.
Some people say I'm the first <unk> of the Arab world.
I never like to reclaim the first place, but I know you never heard that small rumor that says that women are not fun, and they find us very fun.
In 2003, my brother of another mother, and father, Dean <unk> and I launched the <unk> <unk> Festival in New York, now in his 10 year.
Our goal was to change the negative image of the <unk> in the media and in the time you can remind the <unk> <unk> and Arabic <unk>
It was so much easier to fight the challenge of the stigma of disability.
My great opportunity came in 2010.
I was invited to invite the news program for cable it has the back of Keith <unk>
And I went to a graduate dance, and I went back to a study and sat on a <unk> wheelchair.
I looked at the director and I said, "Excuse me, can give me another <unk>
She looked at me and said, <unk> four, three, <unk>
And we were in <unk>
So I held on the desk of the speaker to not get out of the screen during the <unk> and when the interview, was <unk>
I finally had my opportunity and <unk> I knew they wouldn't come back to me.
But not only Mr. <unk> went back to <unk> but it was just like I was full of full-time and hit my chair.
Something fun that I learned in direct with Keith <unk> was that people on the Internet are <unk>
It is said that kids are <unk> but it never occurred to me or no longer than any more.
All of a sudden, my disability on the Internet became an object of <unk>
I would play online clips like, "Why do you <unk>
"It's <unk>
And my favorite favorite, <unk> terrorist <unk>
What disease does it have?
We should really pray for her."
An <unk> suggested even my disability to my <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> is as visual as race.
If somebody in a wheelchair can't do that <unk> then you can't make somebody in a wheelchair.
The disabled are the <unk> Yes, <unk> man. Come on.
The disabled are the largest minority in the world, and the most <unk> in the world of entertainment.
The doctors were saying that I don't know -- but I'm here in front of you.
However, having grown up with media, I don't think it <unk>
I hope that together we can create more positive images of disability in the media and everyday life.
Maybe if there were more positive images that would be <unk> less hate on the Internet.
Or maybe not.
Maybe we need the whole society to teach our children.
My <unk> journey has led me to very spectacular places.
I came to <unk> by the red carpet -- <unk> by the <unk> Susan <unk> and the famous <unk> <unk>
I got to act on a movie with Adam <unk> and working with my <unk> incredible Dave <unk>
<unk> the Arab world, "The Arabs have become <unk>
I was <unk> in representation of the great state of New Jersey in the <unk> of 2008.
And I founded <unk> <unk> a charity to give Syrian refugee children in a small part of what my parents <unk>
It was the only time my father watched me live, and I'm doing this talk to her memory.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
I call myself <unk> <unk> and if I can, you can also can.
I'd like to tell you a story about a child of a small town.
I don't know his name, but I know his story.
She lives in a small village to the South <unk>
This village is close to <unk>
<unk> drives a small village to poverty and on the edge of the <unk>
Without anything for him there, it goes to the big city, in this case, <unk> the Somalia.
When it comes there, there are no opportunities, there are no work, no job <unk>
He's just living in a tent in the city outside of <unk>
After maybe a year -- nothing.
One day you read a guy who offers him to take him back to dinner, <unk>
They went to a dynamic group of people, which gives you a break.
She gets a little bit of money to buy new clothes, money to send home their family.
They presented to a young lady.
He finally got home.
It starts a new life.
It has a goal of life.
A beautiful day in <unk> under a blue sky, <unk> a bomb car.
That boy from that small town with the dreams of the great city was the <unk> terrorist and that group dynamic people were the <unk> a terrorist organization to the Qaeda.
So how do the story of a small town trying to fulfill their dreams in the city ends with him <unk>
He was waiting.
I was waiting for an opportunity, hoping to start his future, waiting for a future perspective, and this was the first thing you arrived.
This was the first thing that he pulled it out of what we call the <unk> period.
And its story repeats in urban centers around the world.
It's the story of the <unk> young unemployed <unk> <unk> riots in <unk> <unk> riots in London, which are looking for something beyond the <unk> of <unk>
For young people, the promise of the city, the great dream of the city is the opportunity, of jobs, but young people don't participate in the prosperity of their cities.
It's often the youth that suffers from the highest rates of unemployment.
By 2030, three of five people living in cities will be under 18 years.
If we don't include young people in the growth of our cities, if they don't give them opportunities, the story of the <unk> of <unk> the door to terrorism, to violence, to be the story of cities.
And in my hometown, <unk> 70 percent of the young people are <unk>
And 70 percent don't work, not to school.
They don't really do anything.
I went back to <unk> last month, and I went to visit the Hospital.
I remember being in front of that hospital to <unk> thinking, and if I never had left?
And if I had seen me forced to be in that same <unk> <unk>
I would have become <unk>
I'm not really sure the answer.
The reason I was in <unk> that month was actually to harbor a few family leaders at a corporate law.
It was about 90 juvenile leaders <unk>
We sat down and we had an rain of ideas about solutions to the big challenges facing the city.
One of the young people in the room was <unk>
He went to the University of <unk> <unk>
There were no work, no opportunities.
I remember when he said to me, because it was a graduate college college, frustrated, was the perfect white <unk> for Al <unk> and other terrorists, to be <unk>
They were looking for people like it.
But this story takes a different path.
In <unk> the biggest obstacle to the point A to B is the streets.
<unk> years of civil war have destroyed the traffic system, and a motorcycle can be the easiest way to <unk>
<unk> saw an opportunity and <unk>
It started a company of <unk>
He started <unk> <unk> to the local residents who normally couldn't afford them.
I bought 10 <unk> with the help of her family and friends, and their dream is at some point to expand hundreds of <unk> over the next three years.
Why is this story?
What does this story do differently?
I think their ability to identify and leverage a new opportunity.
It's the corporate spirit and I think that the business spirit can be the most powerful tool against <unk> in <unk>
<unk> young people to be the creators of the economic opportunities that are looking for so lives.
And you can train young people to be entrepreneurs.
I want to talk to you about a young man who attended one of my meetings, Mohamed <unk> a <unk>
I was trained to train some of the young people at the summit of business initiative, and how to be innovative and how to create a culture of business entrepreneurship.
In fact, it's the first <unk> that <unk> has seen over 22 years old, and until recently, until Mohamed came, if you wanted flowers for your <unk> <unk> we were from plastic from abroad.
If you ask someone, "When was the last time you saw flowers.
For those who grew up during the civil war, the answer would be: <unk>
So, Mohamed saw an opportunity.
It started a company of <unk> and design <unk>
I created a farm on the outskirts of <unk> and he started growing <unk> and <unk> who said, they could survive the hard climate <unk>
And he started the delivery of flowers for wedding by creating gardens in the houses, and the city companies and the city, and now it's working in creating the first public park in <unk> in 22 years.
There are no public parks in <unk>
It wants to create a space where families, young people, can go together, and as he says, smell the pink <unk>
By the way, he's not growing pink because they use a lot of water.
So, the first step is to inspire young people, and in that room, the presence of Mohamed had a really profound impact on young people.
They had never thought about starting a business.
They had thought about working for an NGO, working for government, but their story, their innovation, really had a strong impact on them.
It forced them to look at their city as a place of opportunity.
I encouraged them to believe that they could be entrepreneurs, that they could be <unk> of change.
By the end of the day, they already had innovative solutions for some of the biggest challenges facing the city.
They have business solutions for local problems.
So, inspire young people and create a culture of business spirit -- it's really a big step, but young people need capital to make their ideas happen.
They need expertise and orientation for <unk> in developing their businesses.
They send the young people with the resources that they need, <unk> the support that they need to move from conception to creation, and create a <unk> for urban growth.
For me, the business spirit is something more than starting a business.
It's to create a social impact.
Mohamed is not just selling flowers.
I think it's selling hope.
His Millennium Park is how it's called, when it's created, transforming the way people see their city.
<unk> hired kids from the street to help rent and keep <unk> for him.
It gave them a chance to escape the paralysis of the <unk> of <unk>
These young entrepreneurs are having a tremendous impact on their cities.
So my suggestion is to become young people in entrepreneurs, <unk> and <unk> their innovation <unk> and you will have more stories about flowers and <unk> of the Peace that <unk> and <unk> in <unk>
Thank you.
I was about 10 years old, and I went to <unk> with my dad in the <unk> <unk> an area of the north state of New York City.
It was a beautiful day.
The <unk> forest.
The sun was doing that the leaves <unk> like a <unk> and not to be on the way that we were trying to do -- we could almost pretend that we were the first human beings to step on that land.
We got to our camp.
It was a shed in a <unk> with a beautiful lake with a beautiful lake and I discovered something nasty.
Behind the shed there was a <unk> of about four square feet with apple hearts with apple hearts and <unk> <unk> <unk>
And I was <unk> I was very mad and incredibly <unk>
The <unk> who were too lazy to get out what they thought was going to clean up their <unk>
That question followed with me, and it was <unk> a little bit.
Who clean our <unk>
No matter how you <unk> or where you can do the <unk> who clean our trash in <unk>
Who clean our trash in Rio or in Paris or in <unk>
Here in New York, the Department of <unk> clean our trash, which is about 11,000 tons of waste and 2,000 tons of recyclable products every day.
I wanted to know as individuals.
I wanted to understand who does that work.
What does it feel like to use the uniform and take that <unk>
So I started a research project with them.
I traveled in the trucks and walked down the truck and I interviewed people in offices and facility across the city, and I learned a lot, but it was still a <unk>
I needed to go into a little bit more.
So I started working as a trash <unk>
Now I didn't just travel in the trucks. I <unk>
And operated the mechanical <unk> and <unk> the snow.
It was a remarkable privilege and an amazing learning.
They all ask about smell.
It's there, but it's not as prevalent as you believe -- and in the days that it's very strong one will be <unk> quickly.
It costs a lot to get used to weight.
I met people who had worked on it for several years and their bodies kept <unk> the weight of getting on his body tons of garbage all weeks.
It's also the danger.
According to the Office of FBI <unk> the collection of waste is one of the ten <unk> of the country, more dangerous than the country, and I learned why.
You're going out and moving into the traffic all day and they pass around around you.
They just want to <unk> so the driver is not paying attention.
That's very bad for the <unk>
And also the garbage itself is full of dangers that often fall out of the truck and make terrible <unk>
I also learned about the garbage trash.
When you get out of the <unk> and you see a city from the back of the truck, you get to understand that the garbage is as a force of nature itself.
It never leaves coming.
It's also like a form of breathing or circulation.
It should always be in motion.
And there's also the stigma.
It seems to me that stigma is especially ironic because I believe that the <unk> of waste is the most important work hand in the streets of the city, for three reasons.
They are the first protective <unk>
If you don't get rid of waste and efficient and less effective and effective and every day, this starts to spread out of their containers and their dangers inherent we will threaten us in very real ways.
Control that we had <unk> for decades and centuries and started <unk>
<unk> needs.
If we can't get rid of how old we don't have space for what the economics of the economy begin to fail when it's endangered consumption at all.
I'm not advocating for capitalism, just pointing its relationship.
And then it's what I call our average average speed of the necessary.
With that, I mean by simply the speed of which we used to move used in the <unk>
We don't usually get <unk> or <unk> or we take us with us our coffee cup -- our bag of <unk> our water bottle.
We use them -- we forget about them, because we know that there is a work force on the other side that will take place.
So today I want to suggest to you a couple of ways of thinking about waste waste that will help reduce the stigma and push it into that conversation about how to design a sustainable and human city.
His work, I think, is almost <unk>
They're on the street every day, <unk>
They use a uniform in many cities.
Do you know when you were <unk>
And their work allows us to do our own.
It's almost a form of relief.
The flow that keep us apart from ourselves, from our own <unk> our <unk> and that flow must always stay in one way or another.
One day after September 11, 2001, I heard the <unk> of a waste truck collection on the street, grabbed my son <unk> and I went downstairs and had a man doing his journey of recycled paper as I did all the <unk>
And I tried to thank you for doing this particular day, but I started crying.
And he looked at me and just <unk> and said, "We're going to be fine.
We're going to be right."
Shortly after that started to research the collection of waste and I went back to see that man.
It's called <unk> and we work together a lot of times and we made good friends.
I want to believe that <unk> was right.
We're going to be fine.
But in our efforts to <unk> the way we exist on this planet as we have to include and have to account all the costs, even the actual human cost of labor labor.
The city waste is what we think when we're talking about garbage represent three percent of the amount of waste from the nation.
It's a remarkable statistic <unk>
So in the flow of their days and their lives, the next thing you see someone whose work is to clean up the trash of you, <unk> a moment to <unk>
I would take a moment to tell you thank you.
My work is focused on the connection of thinking about our communal life forming part of the environment where architecture is born naturally from conditions and local traditions.
I brought together two recent projects like this.
Both projects are located in the emerging countries, one in Ethiopia and the other in Tunisia.
They also share the fact that different analysis from different perspectives become an essential part of the final work of architecture.
The first example started with an invitation to design a commercial <unk> center in the capital of Ethiopia, Addis <unk>
This is the kind of building that showed us as an example of my team, and to me, about what we had to design.
At first, the first thing I thought was, "I want to go out <unk>
After seeing some of these buildings there are many in the city we realized there are three important aspects to <unk>
In principle, these buildings are almost empty because they have very large stores where people can't afford to buy things.
Second, you need to use a lot of energy because the <unk> coating generates heat into the interior, so you need a lot of <unk>
In a city where this should not happen because it comes to a climate in fact, that goes from 20 to 25 degrees during the entire year.
And third, your view has nothing to do with Africa and Ethiopia.
It's a shame for a place that rich in culture and traditions.
In our first visit to Ethiopia, I was really <unk> with the old market that is this structure to the open air where thousands of people, go and buy things every day to little <unk>
There is also that idea of using the public space to generate external activity.
So I thought, that's what I really wanted to design, not a commercial mall.
But the question was how to build a building modern building, applying these principles.
The next challenge was presented to <unk> the site, which is located in a lot of growth in the city, where much of the buildings that we now see in the image, not yet.
And it's also between two of the parallel streets that don't communicate in a <unk> <unk>
So the first thing we did was create a connection between these two streets, assembling all the entries from the building.
And this is spread from an <unk> <unk> that creates an open air space in the building that was embedded in its own way, in the sun and the rain.
And around this space we have applied the idea of the market with small businesses, which changes on every floor because of the space.
I also thought, how to close the building?
I wanted to find a solution that would go to local climate conditions.
And I started thinking about a similar tissue to a <unk> concrete <unk> to allow the air input and also the light, but in a <unk> way.
Then we were inspired by these beautiful buttons in the <unk>
They have properties of fractal geometry, and this helped me model the <unk>
We're building that with these little <unk> pieces that are the windows that leave the air and light in a way controlled inside the building.
This is <unk> with these little colors crystals that use light from inside the building to illuminate the building at night.
With these ideas not easy to convince the developers because they thought, "That's not a mall. It wasn't what I <unk>
But ultimately we all realized that this market idea was to be much more profitable than the commercial center of the mall because at the end of the mall there were more local to sell.
And also the idea of the facade was much more economic -- not only because of the material compared to the glass, but also because it wasn't necessary to have air conditioning.
So we get certain savings in the budget that we use to implement the project.
The first thing was to think about how to achieve the energy <unk> for the building in a city where electricity is cut almost every day.
So we get a big advantage by putting <unk> on the roof.
And then under those panels we think about the roof as a new public space with areas of meeting and bars that would create this oasis of city.
And these <unk> on the roof, which are collected water for the <unk>
It's expected for the beginning of the next year, because we're going through the fifth floor of the construction.
The second example is a master plan of 2,000 apartments and services in the city of Tunisia.
And to perform a big project, the biggest thing I have designed, needed not only to understand the city of Tunisia, but also its environment, their tradition and culture.
During that analysis, I put special attention in the <unk> a <unk> structure that was surrounded by a wall with twelve <unk> doors connected by <unk>
When I went to the place, the first design operation that we did was to extend the streets and the existing blocks of creating 12 initial blocks in size and features in Barcelona and other cities in Europe with these <unk>
In addition to that, we select some points strategic points in relation to the idea of <unk> doors with straight lines, and that changed the initial model.
And the last operation was thinking about the cell, the small cell of the project -- as an apartment, as an essential part of the master plan.
I thought, what would the best orientation for an apartment in the climate <unk>
And it's <unk> because it creates a thermal difference between both sides of the house and therefore a natural ventilation.
So I would give you a scheme that claims that most of the apartments are perfectly <unk> in that direction.
And this is the result that it's almost like a combination of the European block and the Arab city.
It has these blocks with <unk> and then in the lower plant, we have all the connections to <unk>
They also respond to local norms that they set up more density at the upper levels and a lower density in the ground floor.
And it also reinforces this idea of the doors.
The roof, which is my favorite space of the project is almost like giving into the community occupied by construction.
It's where all the neighbors, they can go up and get them together and make activities like a <unk> race in the morning, or jump from a building to another.
These two examples, have a common approach to design process.
And also, they're in emerging countries, where you can see cities literally grow.
In these cities, the impact of architecture in the life of people changes local communities and economies at the same rate growing up buildings.
For this reason, I see even more important to look at architecture for simple solutions, but <unk> that improves the relationship between the community and the environment, and they have to connect nature to the people.
Thank you very much.
When I was eight years old, a new girl joined our class. It was as remarkable, as you see all the new girls.
It had great amounts of hair, very bright hair and a little <unk> of pencils and it was super strong for the capitals of states, very good for <unk>
I ended up that year and I was full of <unk> until I <unk> my sinister plan.
One day I stayed at a time after the school, I was a little bit afternoon, and I was sitting in the girls' bathroom.
When the coast was <unk> salt, I walked into the classroom, I took my teacher to my teacher grades.
And then I did.
I took grades of my <unk> just a little bit, just some of them.
All of the name --  And I got to give back the book to the <unk> but to see, some of my other colleagues had really good notes as well.
So in a <unk> <unk> the notes all over the world, without any imagination.
I put all rows of <unk> and myself a row in this way, just for being there, since I <unk>
I'm still surprised what I did.
I don't understand how the idea came from.
I don't understand why I felt well doing it.
I felt important.
I don't understand why I never get <unk>
It's that it was all obvious enough.
I never <unk>
But most of all, I was told, the reason I was bothered by that this <unk> so small was so good at <unk>
I was <unk> the jealousy.
They're so mysterious and so <unk>
We know that babies suffer from jealousy.
Also the primates. The birds are very <unk>
We know that <unk> are the number one cause number one <unk>
And yet, I've never seen a study that look at loneliness, or the long duration or the sadness.
So you have to go to the fiction, because novels are like the laboratory in which they study <unk> in all its possible shapes.
In fact, I don't know if it's an exaggeration to say that if there were no <unk> I would have no literature.
Well, there would be no <unk> there would be no <unk>
There would be no king <unk> or <unk> and a <unk>
No Shakespeare.
<unk> the <unk> lists of high school, because we would be losing "The <unk> and the <unk> would not have <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
<unk> no <unk> I know it's fashionable to say that <unk> has the answers for everything, and in terms of <unk> almost all of them.
This year was 100 years of his work <unk> "In the <unk> of the <unk> I was looking for the most <unk> study of sexual <unk> and also the <unk> <unk> -- all we could have.  And thinking about <unk> we have the details -- we have the <unk> right?
We think about a child trying to reconcile sleep.
We think about a <unk> <unk> in <unk>
We forgot how hard that image is.
We forgot about the relentless that it is.
I mean, it's about books that Virginia <unk> said were as hard as <unk> of cat.
I don't know how the cat is <unk> but we assume it's <unk>
So let's see why they go so well together, the novel and the <unk> the <unk> and <unk>
It's going to be very obvious as <unk> they cut down to the person, to their wish, to their <unk> are a very <unk> <unk>
I don't know. I think we get very close to the bone, when we think about what happens when we feel jealousy.
When we feel <unk> we tell ourselves a story.
A story about other people, and those stories make us feel terrible because they're designed for that, to make us feel bad.
Being in storytellers and audience, we know exactly what details are going to do to put the knife, right?
<unk> are making us all amateur <unk> and that's something that I figured out, understood it.
All she does to give me pleasure to another, maybe right now."
And it starts to be said to the same thing that story, and since then, <unk> says that every fresh <unk> that he detects in his lover -- he adds to his collection of instruments of torture in his private camera.
You have to admit that <unk> and <unk> were notoriously <unk>
You know, the <unk> <unk> would have to leave the country, if they wanted to break up with it.
But you don't have to be so <unk> to recognize that it's hard work. Right?
<unk> are <unk>
It's an emotion <unk> You have to <unk>
And how are the <unk>
The <unk> get rid of the information.
<unk> use the details.
The <unk> like the great amounts of hair and the cute little <unk> of <unk>
The <unk> got rid of the photos.
That's why Instagram is so successful --  -- <unk> all the language that is <unk> with the jealousy.
When <unk> is in his <unk> agony of sudden listening behind the doors and <unk> the <unk> of his lover -- then these behaviors.
He says, "Look, I know you think this is <unk> but it's not different than an old text interpretation or looking at a <unk>
He says, "It's all scientific research with real value.
<unk> is trying to show that the <unk> look <unk> and they make us seem <unk> but in its <unk> they're search for knowledge, search for the truth, a really painful truth -- in fact, what to <unk> <unk> the most painful -- the better.
The pain, the <unk> the <unk> These were the pathways to the wisdom of <unk>
He says, "A woman who we need to need, which makes us suffer, it causes us a range of much deeper feelings and vital than a wise man who can be <unk>
It's telling us that we're going to look for women.
No. I think it's trying to say that the <unk> are telling us ourselves.
And there is some other emotion that makes us <unk> in this particular way.
Is there any other emotion to us, our horrible ambition and our horrible ambition and our <unk>
Any other emotion that teaches us to look at the intensity that are so <unk>
Freud would write on this later.
One day, Freud was visited by a young young man who was consumed with the idea that his wife would <unk>
And Freud says there was something strange in that man, who didn't get <unk> in what his wife.
Well, she was <unk> everybody knew it.
The poor creature was under suspicion without any cause.
But he was looking for things that he was doing his wife, without realizing it, behaviors.
<unk> <unk> or even though he was accidentally <unk> with a man?
Freud says that man was becoming the <unk> of his wife.
The novels are really good at this.
The novels described very well how the <unk> are making us <unk> but without precision.
In fact, the more intensely <unk> we are, more of us become the residents of fantasy.
And for this reason, I think, the <unk> are taking us to do violent and illegal acts.
<unk> drive us to behave in totally <unk>
Now I'm thinking of myself in my case at 8 years, but I'm also thinking about this story that I heard in the news.
A woman from 52 years old, was captured by having created a fake display on Facebook since which would be sent <unk> by itself, for one year.
For one year, every year.
She was trying to bring him back to the new girlfriend of his former <unk> I have to say when or this, I reacted to <unk>
Because let's be realistic.
How huge, even though you -- creativity. Right?
It's kind of novel.
Like a 21st-century novel.
<unk> is one of my favorites.
She's a very strange and brilliant character of American literature.
It's the author of <unk> in a <unk> and "The <unk> Mr. <unk> books that are trying to make our minds, and once we are on the sphere, in the realm of <unk> the membrane that separates what it might be, can be <unk> in a moment.
Let's take Tom <unk> his most famous character.
Tom <unk> goes from <unk> or wanting what you have to get away from your own and <unk> from what you ever <unk> and it's under the floor <unk> to your name, takes your <unk> <unk> your <unk> accounts for you.
It's a way.
But what do we do? We can't take the route of Tom <unk>
I can't give you <unk> all over the world, as much as I wanted to.
It's a shame, because we live in times of envy.
We live in times of jealousy.
I mean, we're good citizens of social networks, where the currency is <unk> right?
The novels show us <unk> I'm not safe.
So we're going to do what the characters always do when they're not sure, when you're in front of a mystery.
Let's go to <unk> Street and ask for <unk> <unk>
When people think about <unk> you think about <unk> <unk> at Professor <unk> that criminal genius.
But I've always got <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that needs <unk> <unk> needs the genius of <unk> but it bothers it.
Oh, it sounds so <unk>
<unk> needs their help, but you get it <unk> and <unk> with <unk> in the one of the puzzles.
But as they work together, something starts to change, and then finally in "The <unk> of <unk> <unk> once <unk> in <unk> <unk> all with his solution, <unk> <unk> and says, "We're not <unk> Mr. <unk>
We're proud of <unk>
And he tells you that there is no person in <unk> <unk> who don't want to shake your hand.
It's one of the times that we see <unk> <unk> in history. It seems to me very emotional -- that scene is also mysterious, right?
It seems to treat them as a problem of geometry, no emotion.
You know, in a minute <unk> it's on the opposite side of <unk>
The next minute they're on the same side.
All of a sudden, <unk> allows us to admire that idea of him to be the <unk>
It could still be so easy?
What if the <unk> are really a matter of geometry, just a question of where we allow ourselves to be in relation to another?
Well, maybe we don't have to get rid of the excellence of the other.
We can relate to it.
But I like <unk> plans.
So as we expect that to happen, we remember that we have fiction for <unk>
Only fiction just <unk> the jealousy.
The fiction alone calls them to the table.
And look at what <unk> the sweet <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk>
We're in great company.
Thank you.
We used to solve big problems.
On July 21, of 1969, Buzz Aldrin jumped out of the Apollo module of Apollo 11 and landed on the Ross Sea <unk>
Armstrong and <unk> were themselves, but their presence on the gray surface was the culmination of a collective process <unk>
The Apollo program was the biggest mobilization.
To get to the moon for NASA spent about 180 billion dollars of today, or four percent of the federal budget.
The Apollo gave work to about 400,000 people and asked with 20,000 companies, universities and government agencies.
People were killed, including the Apollo crew team.
But before the Apollo program <unk> 24 men went to the moon.
And he walked over his surface, which <unk> the <unk> of Armstrong in the past year, is now the most <unk>
So why do you start?
They didn't brought up a lot of <unk> <unk> pounds of old rocks, and something that 24 percent later, a new sense of the <unk> and the fragility of our common home.
Why did the cynical answer is that it was because President Kennedy wanted to demonstrate to the <unk> that this nation had better rockets.
But the words of Kennedy at the University of Rice in <unk> give us a better idea.
John F. <unk> some people ask you, why do you <unk>
Why does it turn it into our goal?
And you could also ask, why is it scaling the mountain <unk>
35 years ago, why would fly over the <unk>
Why plays Rice against <unk>
We chose to go to the moon.
We chose to go to the moon.
We chose to go to the moon in this decade, and do other things, not because they're simple, but because they're hard.
Jason <unk> For the <unk> the Apollo was not just a victory of the West about the Cold War.
In the time, the stronger emotion was the wonder of the significance of the technology of technology.
It was because it was great to be able to do it.
The landing on the moon happened in a context of a long list of technology.
The first half of the 20th century produced the assembly line and the plane, penicillin and vaccine for tuberculosis.
In the middle of the century, <unk> <unk> and <unk> smallpox.
The technology seemed to own what Alvin <unk> in 1970 called <unk> <unk>
For most of the history of humanity, we couldn't go faster than a horse, or a ship with candle, but in 1969, the Apollo crew was 10 to 40,000 miles / It's <unk>
Since 1970, any human being has gone back to the moon.
No one has traveled faster than the Apollo crew -- and the optimism optimism about the power of technology has gone to see that problems that we imagine that technology would solve like go to Mars, create a clean energy, cure cancer, or to feed the world population seem to be <unk>
I remember seeing the Apollo <unk>
I was five years old, and my mother told me that I didn't go to the <unk> tube that Saturn <unk>
I knew that this would be the last mission <unk> but I was completely sure that I would get to see the colonies on Mars.
So that psychopath happened to our ability to solve problems with <unk> has become a common place.
We heard it all the time.
We've heard it for the last two days here, at TED.
It seems like the technologists would have found us, and they would have been enriched with trivial toys, things like <unk> applications and social media, or algorithms that speed <unk>
There's nothing wrong with most of these things.
They've <unk> and enriched our lives.
But it doesn't deal with the great problems of humanity.
What happened?
There's an explanation in Silicon Valley, which <unk> that have created a very ambitious companies that are <unk> from the years in which they were <unk> -- Microsoft, Apple and <unk>
Silicon Valley says that markets are the guilty, in particular, the incentives that venture capitalists offers to entrepreneurs.
Silicon Valley says that the risk investment caused the creation of <unk> ideas by the funding of problems -- or even false problems.
But I don't think this is good enough.
<unk> mainly what's going wrong in <unk> Valley.
Even when venture capitalists were at their high point without worrying about the risk, they preferred investments that could go out in 10 years.
<unk> have always had problems to invest in technologies as a energy, that they need a huge capital and development that is in the long term.
No, the reasons we can't solve big problems are more complicated and profound.
Sometimes, we choose to solve big problems.
Could we go to Mars if you <unk>
NASA has even designed a plan.
But going to Mars it would require a political decision that was popular and that will never happen.
We won't go to Mars because everybody thinks there are things more important than doing on Earth.
Sometimes, we can't solve big problems because political systems fail.
Today, less than two percent of global energy consumption comes from energy sources like solar and wind and <unk> Less than two percent, and the reason is completely cheap.
Coal and natural gas are cheaper than solar and wind, and oil is cheaper than <unk>
We want sources of alternative energy that can compete at the price.
Now, technologists, entrepreneurs and economists agree on what politics and international treaties <unk> the development of an <unk> energy, <unk> a significant increase in research and energy development, and some kind of control of the coal.
But there is no hope in the modern political climate that we're going to see an energy policy or international treaties that reflect that consensus.
Sometimes the big problems that look like technology, turn out not to be.
We know since the famines are a result of failure to food <unk>
But 30 years of research have taught us that famines are policies that affect the distribution of food.
The technology can improve things like harvest or systems for storage and delivery of food, but there will be famines of them as bad governments.
Finally, the big problems sometimes <unk> a solution because we don't understand the problem.
The president Nixon gave the war to cancer in 1971, but soon we discovered that there are many kinds of cancer, some terribly resistant to treatment, and only over the last 10 years, seem to have found effective treatments and viable.
The hard problems are hard.
It's not true that we can't solve the problems with technology.
We can and need -- but these four elements have to be <unk> The political leaders and the population should want to solve the problem, the institutions must support the <unk> it must be really about a <unk> problem, and we have to understand it.
The <unk> mission that has become something like a metaphor for the ability of technology to solve big problems, and it does with those <unk>
But it's a <unk> model in the future.
We're not in <unk>
There is no competition for the Cold War, there is no political competition as the Cold War, there is no politician like John Kennedy <unk> how difficult and dangerous, and there is no popular mythology of science fiction like exploring the solar system.
In general, go to the moon turned out to be simple.
I was only three days.
And really, I wasn't even <unk> no problem.
We're alone in our present, and the solutions of the future will be more difficult to get.
God knows that we don't have the challenges.
Thank you very much.
Well, I'm going to talk about trust, and I'm going to start to start <unk> the ideas that have about trust.
They're so common that they've become <unk> in our society.
I think they're three.
The first one is a <unk> there have been a huge decline of trust, is a very general wisdom.
The second is a goal: we should have more trust.
And the third is a <unk> we should recover confidence.
I think the <unk> the goal and the task is <unk>
What I'm going to try to tell you about today is a different story about a <unk> a goal and a task, and I think it gives a more clear idea about the subject.
First of all, why do people think that trust has <unk>
And if I think about the basis of my own <unk> I don't know the answer.
I bow to think that there may be dropped in some activities or institutions and that might have increased in others.
I don't have that clear.
But I can look at surveys surveys and opinion polls are supposed to be the source of belief that trust has decreased.
When you look at surveys of opinion over time, there is no evidence of it.
I mean, the people who are <unk> 20 years ago, mostly journalists and politicians, follow the same <unk>
And the people who were very reliable about 20 years ago, they still have a lot of <unk> the ultimate nurses.
The rest of us are in the middle, and by the way, the average citizen of the street is almost exactly halfway away.
But that's enough?
What gender opinion polls are, of course, opinions.
What else can you get?
What you see is <unk> attitudes that people have, when they get certain questions.
<unk> in the <unk> <unk> in the <unk>
Now, if somebody would ask you, <unk> in the <unk>
<unk> in the <unk>
<unk> in <unk> teachers.
You probably ask for asking, "What do you do what?"
And that would be a very sensible answer.
And you could say, when you've answered your question, "Well, I trust some, but in other no."
What's very rational.
Ultimately, in real life, we tend to deposit confidence <unk>
We don't assume that the level of trust we're going to feel for a certain kind of <unk> officer or type of person, it's going to be uniform in every single cases.
I could, for example, I would say I trust a certain elementary teacher I know to give you the kind of reading, but in any way to drive the school <unk>
After all, I could know that it wasn't a good <unk>
I could trust my most <unk> friend to keep a conversation, but no, maybe to keep a secret.
Simple.
And if we've gotten those evidence in our everyday lives in the way that trust is <unk> why we stop all that knowledge when we think about trust in a more <unk> way.
I believe that surveys are really bad tools to measure the real confidence in real confidence because they try to do the good inherent judgment in fact of trusting something or somebody.
Second, what about the goal?
The goal is to have more trust.
Frankly, I think that's stupid.
It's not that the goal that I <unk>
I would encourage you to have more confidence in what it's <unk> but not what it is.
Ultimately, I am <unk> not to trust what is not reliable.
And I think those people who <unk> their savings with the very rightly called Mr. Madoff, who then disappeared with them, and I think, well, yes, they were too <unk>
Having more confidence that's not an intelligent goal in this life.
<unk> deposited or <unk> with intelligence, that's the right target.
Once you say, it says, yeah, yeah, yeah, that means that what it matters in the first place is not trust, but trustworthiness.
What it is about making a judgment of how reliable people are in certain ways.
And I think that to be able to do a trial, we're forced to focus on three things.
They're <unk> They're <unk> They're <unk>
And if we found that one person is <unk> in commodities and it's responsible and honest, then we will have a very good reason to trust it, because it's going to be worthy of trust.
But if, in the contrary, they're not responsible for us to not trust them.
I have friends who are <unk> and honest -- but not <unk> in them to take a letter to the mail because they're <unk>
I have friends who are very sure that they can do certain things, but I see that you can make their own <unk>
And I'm happy to say that I think I don't have a lot of friends who are relevant and responsible for but extremely <unk>
If this is, I still haven't been <unk>
But that's what we're <unk> to do before you trust.
Hope is the answer.
<unk> is what we need to do.
And of course, it's hard.
In the last few decades, we've tried to build accountability systems for all kinds of institutions, professionals, officials and others, that made us easier for the task to judge their trustworthiness.
Many of those systems have had the opposite effect.
They don't work as <unk>
I remember one time I was talking to a <unk> and he said, "Well, you'll see the problem is that it takes more time to do the mathematical <unk> that will be <unk>
And we found the same problem in all of our public life, and <unk> that the accountability of accountability that's meant to ensure the <unk> and <unk> testing is actually doing the opposite.
What they do is <unk> the work of people who have to do hard tasks like the <unk> <unk> that <unk> the <unk> as we say.
You may have similar examples.
We have all of that, by the target.
I believe that the goal should be more <unk> and that things would be different if we were trying to be worthy of trust and to give them to the people that we are reliable and whether other people -- officials or politicians are worthy of trust.
It's not easy. It's the trial, the simple actions -- what it doesn't do properly.
Third, the task.
<unk> the task to rebuild the trust, puts things upside down.
It suggests that you and I should rebuild the trust.
Well, we can do it with ourselves.
We can reconstruct a little bit of trustworthiness.
We can do it if they're two people, together, trying to improve confidence.
But trust, ultimately, it is signature because they give us other people.
You can't rebuild what other people have given you.
You have to give them the foundations enough to be able to trust you.
You have to be worthy of trust.
And that, of course, is because you can't catch it by the general people, all the time.
But you also have to call <unk> evidence that you are worthy of trust.
How do you do it?
That becomes every day, everywhere, makes common people, the <unk> the institutions, very effectively.
Let me give you a simple commercial example.
The store where I bought my socks to say that I can leave you without giving you <unk>
I take them and get it back the money, or the change for the color I want.
That's great. I rely on them because they themselves became vulnerable to me.
I think there's a big lesson at that.
If you're vulnerable to the other part, that's a very good proof that you are worthy of trust and you have trust in what you're saying.
So at the end, I think what we're pointing at is not very difficult to <unk>
What people trust is in relationships, and in that framework, you can determine when and how the other person is worthy of trust.
Thank you.
Since the beginning of computers we've been fascinated by <unk> the separation between us and the digital information, the separation between our material world and the world of the screen that the imagination is <unk>
This separation has gone <unk> increasingly and more, to such a point that today is less than one millimeter, the thickness of the glass of a tactile screen, and the power of computing has become accessible to everyone.
But I ask myself, and if I wouldn't have <unk>
I started to imagine how it would be.
So first he created this tool that was embedded in the digital space, so that when the strong force against the screen transfers their physical body as well.
Designers can take their ideas directly in 3D, and surgeons can practice with virtual organs under the screen.
So with this tool you break the barriers.
But the two hands remain still out of the screen.
How do you get inside and interact with digital information, using the whole skill of your hands?
In the <unk> <unk> division of Microsoft, along with my mentor <unk> <unk> <unk> the computer and transformed a small space on the keyboard in a working digital area.
We put a bombsight with a depth of depth of depth to detect your fingers and the face, now you can lift the hands of the keyboard, getting the interior of the 3D space and grab pixels directly with our hands.
As the windows and the files have a location in real space -- it's as easy as a book of a <unk> book.
You can flip through the book and <unk> lines or words with the virtual touch sensor that there are down every floating screen.
The architects can stretch or rotate their models directly with our hands.
In these examples, we type in the digital world.
And if you invest the papers and make the digital information come to us us?
And so many of us will be bought and made things on the Internet.
Now that doesn't have to worry about.
What I have here is a virtual <unk> on the Internet.
This is the vision that you get from a device mounted in your head or <unk> when the system is understanding the geometry of your body.
If we took this idea further, I thought, instead of just seeing pixels in space, how we can make physical physicists so that we can <unk> and <unk>
How would a future like this?
At the MIT Media Lab with my Professor Hiroshi Ishii, and my collaborator <unk> Post, the only physical pixel in the Media <unk>
This magnet magnet is behaving as a 3D pixel in space, which means so much the computer as users can move the object anywhere inside this little three-dimensional space.
<unk> what we did was we <unk> gravity and control the movement through a combination of levitation -- <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And by programming the object, we released it from the constraints of time and space, which means that human movements can <unk> and go back to reproduce and stay in the physical world.
You can teach it physically and distance and the famous shot by Michael Jordan can be reproduce as a physical reality as we want to.
Students can use it as a tool to understand complicated concepts like the movement of planets, physics, and unlike monitors or text, this is a real and palpable experience that you can play and feel.
But what's more fascinating than changing the physical part of the computer is to imagine how to program the world is going to change our physical activities.
As you see, digital information will not only show us something but to begin to act directly on us as part of the physical world that surrounds us without having to get rid of our world.
We start the talk today talking about a barrier, but if you put that barrier, the only limit that's left is our imagination.
Thank you.
I was <unk> to become <unk> for two years in <unk> China, in the <unk>
When I was in first grade, the government wanted to take a school for athletes with all expenses paid.
But my tiger mother said, "No."
My parents wanted to become engineering, like them.
After surviving the Cultural Revolution -- they believed that there were only an effective path to the <unk> a safe job and <unk> job.
No matter whether I work or not.
But my dream was to be an American opera singer in it.
This was me, in my imaginary piano.
An opera singer must start <unk> from very young to learn the <unk> so I tried everything I could get to the opera school.
I had emailed to the director of school and on a radio show.
But no adult would give you the idea.
No adult took me seriously.
Only my friends were <unk> but they were kids, without authority, like me.
So at age 15, I knew that it was too much more to train.
My dream never <unk>
I would argue that during the rest of my life a second class of second class was the only thing I could aspire to.
And this was so unfair.
So I resolved to look for another <unk>
Nobody around me wanted to <unk> OK.
Let's go back to books.
<unk> <unk> from <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and what were the first books I read here?
Those who were fighting in China, of course.
"The Good <unk> is about American <unk>
And this is not propaganda <unk> <unk>
The Bible is interesting, but strange.
That's a topic for another day.
But the fifth commandment for me was a <unk> <unk> your father and your mother."
<unk> I told me "It's so different, and much better than you do.
So it became my tool to get out of this cheating trap <unk> and to <unk> the relationship with my parents.
And I find it with a new culture also led to my reading habit of <unk>
<unk> many perspectives.
For example, at the beginning this map seemed to be out of place because this is what the students in China learn.
I had never occurred, that China didn't have to be in the center of the world.
A map means the perspective of people.
The comparative reading is not something new.
It's a common practice in the academic world.
There's to research fields like comparative religion and literature.
<unk> and <unk> offers a deeper understanding of a subject.
And I thought if the comparative reading worked for research, why not do it in everyday life.
So I started reading books from two.
They can be <unk> <unk> from Walter <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> who were involved in a <unk> or friends with <unk> experiences.
By <unk> the <unk> are economic and spiritual <unk>
For Buddha, they're all <unk> lust, fear and <unk> <unk>
If you know another language, it's also fun to read their favorite books in two languages.
<unk> path of <unk> Thomas <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- rather than lost in the translation, found that you can win a lot of it.
For example, it's through the translation that I realized that <unk> in Chinese literally means <unk> <unk> <unk>
And <unk> in Chinese literally means <unk> <unk> <unk>
The books came to me a magic door to connect with people from the past and the present.
I know I'm not going to feel like I was alone or powerless before.
Having a dream was really not compared to what many others have <unk>
I've come to believe that realization is not the only purpose of a dream.
Their most important purpose is to connect with the place that the dreams, where the dreams, where the passion, where your passion, it comes from.
Until a dream <unk> can do that for you.
And it's because of the books, that I'm here, happy, living again with purpose and clearly, most of the time.
So the books are always <unk>
Thank you.
Thank you.  Thank you.
When I was in my <unk> I saw my first client <unk>
I was a Ph.D. student in clinical psychology in Berkeley.
She was a <unk> woman named <unk>
Alex walked into the first session using jeans and a <unk> came up on the couch on my office and he took her shoes off and said he wanted to talk about his problems with men.
When I heard this, I felt so <unk>
My classroom had a <unk> as a first client.
And I was a <unk> I wanted to talk about men.
I thought I could handle it.
But I didn't.
With the <unk> stories that Alex brought to the sessions, became easy to just move my head while I was going to make the solution.
<unk> the new <unk> said, Alex, and what I looked like, she was right.
You start to work after, you go home after, she has children later on the death later.
For <unk> as Alex and I had time to eat.
But shortly after, my <unk> pushed me to press Alex who would talk about his life <unk>
I was <unk>
I said, "Yeah, he's coming out with guys under his category -- she would sit with a head <unk> but it's not like it was to marry him."
And then my <unk> said, "No, no, but maybe it's going to be <unk>
In addition, the best time to work on Alex marriage is before they were <unk>
This is what psychologists call a <unk> moment.
It was when I realized the <unk> are not the new <unk>
Yes, people feel head after what they <unk> but this didn't do the Alex <unk> of Alex being a break.
This made the Alex <unk> of Alex were the perfect time, and we were <unk>
So I realized, that this kind of <unk> benign was a real problem, and it had real consequences, not only for Alex and his loving life, but for careers, the families and the future of <unk> all over the place.
There are 50 million <unk> in the United States, today.
This means 15 percent of the population, or 100 percent if you think no one comes to adulthood without going through the <unk>
Raise your hand if you're in your <unk>
I want to see the <unk> here.
Oh, Yes! They're amazing.
If you work with <unk> they love a <unk> you take your dream a <unk> I want to see. All right. <unk> <unk> truth matter.
This is not just my opinion. These are the facts.
We know that 80 percent of the key moments in life will go to 35 years.
This means that eight out of 10 decisions and experiences and moments -- they give you a way to your life that you will have been in the time you have 30 and <unk>
People for more than 40, they don't panic panic.
This audience is going to be okay, I think.
We know that the first 10 years of a career has an exponential impact on the amount of money that we do.
We know that more than half of Americans are married, they live or come out with their future partner at 30 years.
We know that the brain ends up their second and final phase of growth in their <unk> and they were <unk> for <unk> which means that if there is something you want to change themselves, now it's time to change it.
We know that the personality changes more times during their <unk> than at any other time of life, and we know that the female fertility comes at its top to 28 and things become complicated to the <unk>
The <unk> are the time to <unk> on your body and their options.
When we think about the development of the child, we all know that the first five years are crucial for language and attachment in the brain.
It's a moment in which your everyday life and common life has an impact on the person who is <unk>
But what we don't hear is that there is something called adult development and our <unk> are a critical moment in adult development.
But this is not what the <unk> are listening.
The newspapers talk about changes at the time of the time of adulthood.
The researchers call the <unk> an extended adolescence.
<unk> gave them <unk> names to the <unk> as <unk> and <unk>
It's true.
As a culture, we've considered a <unk> which is actually the decade that defines adulthood.
Leonard <unk> said that to achieve great things, you need a plan and not enough time.
Isn't it?
What do you think happens when you give one <unk> in your head and they say, you have another 10 years to start your <unk>
Nothing happens.
They stole that person the sense of urgency and her ambition and his ambition and absolutely nothing.
And then every day, there are smart, smart, interesting people like you or your children and daughters get to my office and say something like this: "I know that my boyfriend is not good for me, but this relationship doesn't know.
Or they say, "Everybody says that while I start a career before the 30, everything will be right."
But then it starts to sound something like this: "My <unk> are <unk> and I still have nothing to show you.
I had a better post the day I graduated from <unk>
And then it starts to sound something like this: "My quotes during the <unk> were like the game of chairs.
They were all running and <unk> but then at some point around the 30, it turned out the music and they all started sitting up.
I didn't want to be the only one who would stay stop, so I sometimes think I married my husband because he was the nearest chair when he had <unk>
Where are the <unk> here?
Don't do that.
Well, that sounds just a little bit extreme -- but not <unk> the risks are too high.
When you leave a lot of things for the <unk> there's an enormous amount of pressure to the 30 and so many of you start a career, pick a city, choice a mate, and have two children in a much more short period of time.
Many of these things are not <unk> and there are research that start to show you, which is much more difficult and stressful to do everything from once to <unk>
The middle-aged crisis is not about buying red sports cars.
It's about realizing you can't have the career you want now.
<unk> you can't have the son you want now, or you can't give a brother to your son.
A lot of <unk> and <unk> looked at themselves, and I sat in the room, and they talk about his <unk> "What was he doing? What was you thinking?"
I want to change what the <unk> are doing and thinking.
Here's a story about how it might be.
It's a story about a woman named <unk>
At 25, Emma came to my office because it was, in his own words, having an identity.
He said I'd like to work in art or entertainment, but I still couldn't decide, so I spent the last few years working as <unk>
As it was cheaper, I lived with a boyfriend that showed more <unk> than ambition.
And even though I live a very difficult <unk> his previous life had been even more difficult.
It was often in our sessions, but then he got up to the say, "You don't choose your family, but you can choose your friends."
Well, one day Emma got his head on his legs and cried for almost all the hour.
I just had to buy a new book <unk> and I had spent all the morning <unk> with his many relationships, but then he stayed looking at empty space that follows after the words "In <unk> please call <unk> <unk>
I was about to the <unk> when he saw me and said, "Who will be for me if I have a <unk> accident.
Who is going to take care of me if I was <unk>
At that time, I took a lot of work to resist and say, <unk>
What Emma needed was not a <unk> that actually <unk>
Emma needed a better life, and I knew this was his opportunity.
I had learned a lot since I worked with Alex as for just sitting while the Emma <unk> were going to go ahead.
So, for the next weeks and months, I told Emma three things that all <unk> man or woman, deserves to know.
First of all, I said to Emma who came up with that crisis of identity and <unk> capital.
For capital capital, I mean doing something that add value to your person.
Doing something that is an investment in what you want to be next.
I didn't know the future of <unk> and no one knows the future of work, but I know this: capital capital generates capital.
So now it's the time for that work of the other side of the country, from that company that you want to try.
I'm not <unk> exploring exploration, I'm <unk> the exploration that I shouldn't tell -- which, by the way, is not <unk>
It's <unk>
I said to Emma who was looking for jobs and to make them tell.
Second, I told Emma that urban tribes are <unk>
The best friends are great to take you at the airport, but the <unk> who come together with friends with similar minds are limited as soon as you know what you know about, what you know, how you think, how to talk, and where they work.
That new piece of capital, that new person who gets out almost comes from the outside of their closest cycle.
The new things come from what they're called weak <unk> friends of their friends.
Yes, half of the <unk> have a bad job or they don't have a job.
But the other half no, and the weak links are the shape of <unk> to this group.
Half of the work created never been <unk> then knowing the head of your neighbor is the way to get a work not published.
It's not cheating. It's the science of how information happens.
For the last but not least, Emma believed that you don't choose your family, but I know your friends.
This was true when I was growing up, but like <unk> Emma will soon <unk> his family, when she has a partner and his own family.
I told Emma that the time to choose his family had come.
Maybe you think that 30 is better age to sit head than the 20 or even the 25 and I agree with you.
But choosing the person that you live in now or <unk> now when everyone on Facebook are starting to walk towards <unk> it's not progress.
The best time to work in your marriage is before you do, and that means to be so intentional in love as you are at work.
<unk> your family must be a conscious choice of who and what they want instead of just going to work or kill time with anyone to choose you.
So what happened to <unk>
Well, we looked at that <unk> and she found the fourth quarter of a cousin who worked in an art museum in another state.
This weak link helped him get a work there.
That job supply gave him a reason to leave the boyfriend with the living thing.
Now, five years later, it's <unk> special events in museums.
This married a man who chose <unk>
<unk> his new career, loves her new family, and I would send a letter to say, "Now the spaces of emergency emergency spaces are not <unk>
The story of Emma may sound easy, but that's what I love about working with <unk>
It's very easy to help them.
<unk> are like aircraft coming out of the Los Angeles, which come out somewhere in the West.
Just before the <unk> a slight light in his trajectory makes the difference between land in Alaska or in <unk>
In the same way, at 21 or 25 to the <unk> a good conversation, a good break, a good TED Talk can have huge effects in the next few years or even in the next generation.
Here's my idea that's worth spreading to all the <unk> who know about.
It's as simple as what I learned to say to <unk>
It's what I now have the privilege of saying to <unk> like Emma all <unk> The <unk> are not the new <unk> <unk> their <unk> get identity, you get identity, you get your weak user, choose your family.
You don't stop define what they didn't know or what they didn't know.
They're deciding their life today.
Thank you.
When I was 27 years old, I left a very tough job in <unk> <unk> for a work that was even more <unk> <unk>
I was going to teach them mathematics to seventh grade students in New York public schools.
And as any professor, I took tests and tests.
I give tasks.
When I work back, we will save grades.
What was struck by me was that the I.Q. was not the only difference between my best and my worst students.
Some of them who had a better performance didn't have scores of <unk> <unk>
Some of my smartest kids were not going so well.
And that got me thinking.
The kind of thing you need to learn in mathematics in seventh grade, sure, they're <unk> <unk> <unk> the area of a <unk>
But these concepts are not impossible and I was very convinced that every one of my students could learn the lesson if they worked hard and during time.
After several years of <unk> I came to the conclusion that what we need in education is a better understanding of students and learning from a <unk> perspective, from a psychological perspective.
In education, the only thing we know how to measure better way.
It's the <unk> but what if they succeed in school and life depends on much more than the ability to learn differently and easy?
So I left the classroom and went to college to become <unk>
I started studying children and adults in all kinds of <unk> <unk> and in every study my question was, who is successful here and why?
My research team and I went to the <unk> Academy West <unk>
And we tried to predict what they <unk> <unk> on military training and who they <unk>
We went to the National <unk> National <unk> and we tried to predict what children were going to do as far as possible in competition.
We studied faculty <unk> working in neighborhoods really hard, <unk> what teachers are still teaching for the end of the year and <unk> who will be the most effective, to improve the results of their <unk>
We associate with private companies, asking yourself, what about these <unk> are going to keep their job <unk>
And who is going to make more money?
In all those very different contexts, came a feature as a significant success of success.
And it wasn't the social intelligence.
It wasn't the good look, the physical health and wasn't <unk>
It was <unk>
<unk> is passion and <unk> to achieve very long term.
<unk> is to have a <unk>
The determination is clinging to your future, day after day, not only for the week, not only for the month, but for years and working really hard to make that future a reality.
<unk> is to live life as if it was a <unk> not at the speed.
A few years ago, I started studying the determination in public school schools.
I asked thousands of high school students who made my credit questionnaires and then waited for about more than a year to see who was <unk>
It turns out that children with more determination had significantly higher chance of graduation, even when the <unk> in every single feature that I could measure, things like the family income, the results of evidence -- even security they felt when they were in school.
So it's not just in the West Point or in the National <unk> National <unk> where <unk> is also in school, especially for kids at risk for <unk>
For me, the most shocking thing about determination is that we know, how little science does about its development.
Every day, parents and teachers ask me, "How can the determination of determination in kids?
What should I do to teach kids a strong work ethic.
How do I keep them through the long <unk>
The most honest answer is: I don't know.  What I know is that talent doesn't <unk>
Our data shows very clearly that there are many talented individuals who just don't go ahead with their <unk>
In fact, in our data, it's commonly related to it or it's even related to the talent measures.
So far, the best idea I've heard about developing children is something called <unk> <unk>
This is an idea that was developed at Stanford University for Carol <unk> and it's the belief that the ability to learn is not suitable for the effort.
Dr. <unk> has shown that when kids read and learn about the brain and how it changes and it grows in response to the challenge, they are much more prone to <unk> when they <unk> because they don't think that <unk> is a permanent condition.
So the mindset of growth is a great idea to develop <unk>
But we need more.
And that's where my speech, because that's where we are.
That's the work we have on the front.
We need to take our best ideas, our stronger intuitions and we need to <unk>
We need to measure whether they have been successful and we have to be willing to fail, to begin everything again with the lessons <unk>
In other words, we need to be determined about making our kids more <unk>
Thank you.
<unk> in Taiwan as a daughter of a <unk> one of my most <unk> memories is my mother <unk> the beauty, the shape and the shape of the Chinese characters.
Since that time, I was amazed by this incredible language.
But for a abroad, it seems to be as <unk> as the Great Wall China.
In the last few years, I've been wondering if I can break down this <unk> so that anyone who is wanting to understand and appreciate the beauty of this sophisticated language that can do it.
I started thinking about how a new method and quickly learning Chinese could be useful.
Since I was five years old, I started learning how to draw each of the strokes in every character in the right sequence.
I learned new characters every day for the next 15 years.
Since we only have five minutes, it's better than we do it in a faster and simple way.
A Chinese academic academic 20 characters.
You just need a thousand to understand basic literacy
The first 200 will allow you to understand 40 percent of the basic literature -- enough enough to read traffic signals.
Today I'll start with eight to show you how the method works.
Are you ready?
Open your mouth as much as possible until it's <unk>
You get a mouth.
This is a person who's going to go for a walk.
<unk>
If the form of fire is a person with arms on both sides, as if I were yelling at <unk> <unk> I am <unk> this symbol is actually <unk> from the form of called, but I like to believe that it's the other way.
This is a tree.
tree. tree.
This is a mountain.
The sun.
The moon.
The door symbol looks like a couple of doors from a <unk> in the old west.
I call <unk> to these eight characters.
They're building blocks so they create a lot more characters.
One person.
If somebody walks back, that's <unk>
As the old said, two are the crowd.
If one person stretches their arms, this person is saying <unk> this big.
The person inside the mouth, the person is <unk>
It's a bird as <unk> inside the whale.
A tree is a tree. Two trees together, we have a forest.
Three trees together, we also have the forest.
Put a chart under the tree, we have the <unk>
Put a mouth on the tree, that's a <unk>  <unk> to remember, because a single one tree is pretty <unk>
Remember the fire?
Two are together, it's very hot.
Three doors together, that's a lot of fire.
Put the fire under the two trees, that's <unk>
For us, the sun is the source of prosperity.
Two suns together, <unk>
Three together, those are <unk>
Put the sun and the moon shining together, that's the <unk>
It also means tomorrow, after one day and a night.
The sun comes out on the horizon.
A door. Get a chart inside the door, is the <unk> of the door.
Put a mouth inside the door, asking questions.
<unk> had someone at home?
This person is leaving hidden in a door, <unk> <unk>
On the left, we have a woman.
Two women together are <unk>
Three women together, are <unk>
So we've gone for almost 30 characters.
By using this method, the first eight <unk> will allow them to build 32.
The next group of eight characters will build other 32.
So with every little effort, you will be able to learn a couple of hundreds of <unk> which is the same thing to learn a Chinese eight years.
So after knowing the <unk> we started to create sentences.
For example, the mountain and the fire together, we have a mountain of fire. It's a <unk>
We know that Japan is the land of the sun.
This is an sun in the beginning, because Japan is east of China.
So the sun together, we created Japan.
One person behind Japan, what do we have?
A Japanese person.
The character on the left is two mountains stacked over the other.
In the old China, it meant in exile, because the Chinese <unk> <unk> their political enemies beyond the mountains.
Today, the exile has become out.
A mouth that tells you where it is an <unk>
This is a slide to remind me that I should stop talking and go down the stage. Thank you.
What I prefer about being the movies that I get to see.
I love to share my favorite films with my <unk> when my daughter was four years old, we saw the magician of Oz together.
The film took his imagination for months for months.
His favorite character was <unk> of course.
He gave a good excuse to use a bright dress.
But when you see that movie so many times, you get to understand that it's extraordinary.
We now live and raise our children in a kind of an industrial complex <unk>
However, the magician magician was an event itself.
It didn't start that trend.
The trend really took the rise later 40 years later with, interestingly, another movie whose <unk> a boy boy and a boy <unk> <unk> a girl wearing the enemy.
Do you know what I'm talking about?  Yeah.
There's a big difference between these two movies, there's a couple of big differences between the magician of Oz and all the movies that we see today.
One is that there's very little violence on the magician of <unk>
The monkeys are pretty aggressive, like <unk>
But I think if the magician magician got done today, the magician would say, <unk> are salvation of Oz as the self-fulfilling <unk>
It was <unk> magical shoes to beat the United Nations generated by the <unk> <unk>
But that's not what happens.
Another single thing on the magician of Oz is that the most respected characters and even <unk> are women.
I started to notice this when I made Star Wars my daughter, a few years later, and the situation was different.
At that time, I had a son of son.
Only three years.
It wasn't invited to the projection because it was still very small for that.
But it was the second son, and the <unk> level had <unk>  And so she sat in the room and was struck as a mom as a mother with her <unk> behind, and I don't think he understood what was happening, but <unk> <unk> everything.
I wonder what <unk>
Would you be thinking about <unk> <unk> and <unk>
I would have a sense that Luke was an army to overthrow the government?
<unk> this with the magician of Oz <unk>
How does it make Dorothy its movie?
<unk> <unk> with all and being a <unk>
It's the kind of world that I want my kids to grow up to you, and not a world of men who are <unk> which is where we are.
Why is there so much force capital strength in the movies for our children, and so little on the road of <unk>
There's a lot of literature on the impact of male violence from male violence in girls, and they should be <unk> It's very good.
I haven't read so much about how kids react to this encouragement.
I know by experience that the princess princess doesn't provide the proper frame that I would have served to navigate the world of adults who are <unk>  I think at the time of the first <unk> I really hoped that they were going to come up because it's the end of the movie, right?
My search has finished, I have a <unk>
Why do you stop there?
I don't know what I should do.
The movies focus on defeat the <unk> and get their reward, and they don't leave time for other relationships or other <unk>
It's almost like being a child, you have to be a dumb animal, and if you're a girl, you have to use a <unk> suit.
There are a lot of exceptions, and defend the Disney princess before any of you.
But they send a message to the children, even though the kids are not really their target public.
They do a phenomenal job by teaching girls how to defend girls against the <unk> but they don't necessarily show the kids how to defend the <unk>
There's no model for them.
We also have some great women who write new stories for our children, as real and <unk> like <unk> and <unk> but they don't stop being a war movies.
Of course, the most successful theme of all times is continuing to rise up in classical after classic classic every single one of them about the adventures of a child or a man, or two men who are friends, or a man and his son, or two men who raised a child.
Until as many of you are thinking, this year, finally it came out.
I recommend all of you. It's available in shops.
Do you remember what the criticism said when he came out.
I can't believe that Pixar has made a movie of a <unk>
It's very good. Don't let it be <unk>
Well, almost no one of these movies goes on the <unk> test.
I don't know if you've heard about this.
It's still not the roots and already <unk> but maybe we're going to start a movement.
<unk> <unk> is a book of comics, and in the <unk> I recorded a conversation that had had with a friend of the <unk> of the movies that you saw.
And it's very simple. There are only three questions that must be <unk> in the movie, there are more of a female character that has lines?
So, you have to fulfill the requirement.
These women speak to each other at some point in the movie?
Their conversations are about something more apart from the kid than you like it?  All right?  Thank you.  Thank you very much.
Two women that exist and talk about things each other.
<unk> I've seen, and yet very rarely see it in the cinema that we know and love.
In fact, this week, I went to see a very good quality of very good quality, <unk>
Right? <unk> of <unk> success of <unk> a idea of consensus that is a Hollywood Hollywood movie.
<unk> doesn't happen the test test.
And I don't think that <unk> because a lot of the movie, I don't know if you've seen it, a lot of the film happens in a embassy where men and women hide during the <unk> crisis.
We have lots of scenes of men who have deep conversations and painful in this <unk> and it's the great moment for one of the actors to take a look at the door and say, <unk> to bed, <unk>
This is Hollywood.
So let's go in the numbers.
In 2011, of the 100 more popular movies how many of them do they think they have <unk>
<unk> It's not wrong.
It's not the same percentage that the number of women we've chosen recently for Congress, then it's okay.
But there is a larger number that this is going to be <unk> this room.
Last year, The New York Times published a study that the government had done.
This is what he would say.
In the United States, one in five women says it's been sexually assaulted once in his life.
I don't think it's the real entertainment.
I don't think movies for children have something to do with that.
I don't think that music videos or pornography are closely <unk> but something goes wrong, and when I hear that statistics, one of the things I think is that there's a lot of sexual <unk>
Who are those <unk> What are you <unk>
What do you not get <unk>
They are <unk> the story of a male hero is to defeat the <unk> with violence and then charge the reward, which is a woman who has no friends and not <unk>
We are <unk> that story?
You know, as a father with the privilege of raising a daughter like those of you who are doing the same thing, we find this world and this very startling statistic and we want to <unk>
We have tools to our disposal as <unk> <unk> and we expect that to be <unk> <unk> <unk> is going to be <unk> if, at the same time, active or <unk> we're educating our children to keep their power to keep their power.
I mean, I think the list of Netflix is a way to do something really important, and here I mean mainly parents.
I think we have to show our children a new definition of <unk>
The definition of masculinity is radically changing.
You might have read about how the new economy is changing the role of the home and the <unk>
Everything is changing.
When I asked my daughter which was his favorite Star Trek character -- you know what <unk>
<unk>
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
What do you have in common these two?
Maybe it's not just the bright dress.
I think they're experts.
I think these are the two people in those films that know more than anyone, and they love to share their knowledge with other people to try to reach their potential.
They are leaders.
I like that kind of stories for my daughter, and I like that kind of stories for my son.
I want more stories like that.
I want less stories in which I would say to my <unk> Go and fight only and more stories where it looked like their work is to join a team, maybe a team led by women, helping other people to improve and be better people, like the magician of <unk>
Thank you.
As a kid, I was living in Maine, and one of the things that I liked was to search for the sea on the shores of Maine because my parents told me that I would give me luck.
But you know, it's hard to find these <unk>
They're covered in sand and it's hard to see them.
However, over time, I was amazed at <unk>
I started to see shapes and patterns that helped me <unk>
This became a passion for finding things, in love for past and <unk>
And eventually I started studying <unk> I realized that I saw my own eyes not enough.
Because, soon, in Egypt, my little beach in Maine had grown up to a nearly 1.3 miles of length along with the <unk>
And my sea parents had grown the size of cities.
This is really what led me to use satellite images.
In order to try and make a map of the past, I knew I had to see another way.
I want to show you an example of how different we see when we use the <unk>
This is a place in the eastern delta in Egypt called <unk>
And the place is to be brown -- it seems to be brown but when we use the infrared and we process using fake color suddenly the place looks like pink brilliant.
What you're looking at is the real chemical changes of the landscape of the landscape of building and the activities of the ancient elephant.
I want to share with you how we use satellite data to find an old city, a old city, called <unk> for thousands of years.
<unk> was the ancient capital Egypt for over 400 years in a period of time called the Middle Empire about 4,000 years ago.
The place lies in the <unk> Egypt, and it's really important because in the Middle Empire there was this great renaissance of ancient art -- architecture and religion.
<unk> have always known that <unk> was located somewhere near the pyramids of the two kings that the <unk> <unk> within the red circles here, but somewhere within this huge <unk> <unk>
This area is massive, it's about <unk> miles per mile.
Before, <unk> <unk> right next to <unk> and as it changed over time, moved to this and covered in the entire city.
So how do you find a <unk> city in a <unk> landscape.
And I'll try to find that random the equivalent of looking for a needle in a <unk> with the eyes and using baseball <unk>
So, we use NASA <unk> data to make a map of place, with very subtle changes.
We were able to see where the <unk> <unk>
But you can see more <unk> and it's even more interesting, this very high area that you see within the circle here, that we think could be the location of <unk>
So we collaborated with Indian scientists doing <unk> jobs -- you can see it here.
When I say <unk> is like the shots that shows in ice, but instead of layers of climate change, we look for layers of human <unk>
Five feet down, below a thick thick of <unk> we found a dense layer of objects.
This means that in this possible location of <unk> five feet down, we have a layer of occupation of several hundreds of years that date from the Middle World, exactly the same period that we think is <unk>
We also found a job of <unk> <unk> quartz and <unk> which shows that there was a shop shop shop.
This might seem not a lot, but when we think about the most common stones used in the jewelry of the Middle Empire -- these are the stones that are <unk>
So, we have a dense layer of occupation which goes back from the Middle Empire in this place.
We also have evidence of an elite jewelry shop which shows that what has been there, was a very important city.
We still not find <unk> here, but we would bring it to the place in a future near <unk>
And even more importantly, we have the resources to train young Egyptians in the use of satellite technology, so they can also perform great discoveries.
I want to finish with my favorite quote from the Middle Empire probably was written in <unk> 4,000 years ago.
Let me share knowledge is the biggest of all the <unk>
There's nothing like that on Earth.
So as TED as TED was not founded in 1984 yeah.
Do that the ideas really started in 1984 City C. in a lost city not for a long time and found out from the top.
It certainly puts the search for marine shells in perspective.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
I want to invite you to close your eyes.
Imagine standing out in front of the door of <unk> home.
I want you to pay attention to the color of the door, the material that's made of.
Now <unk> a group of obese <unk>
They are competing in a career <unk> and they go in the direction to the entrance door.
I need you to look at this <unk>
They're <unk> strong, they're <unk> they're <unk>
They collide with the door of their house.
There are bikes flying everywhere and wheels that go on the side, rays of the wheels that end up in places that are <unk> <unk> the threshold of the gate,
<unk> to the lobby, or whatever there is on the other side of the door, and look at the quality of light. The light is shining on the <unk> of <unk>
She's waving with your hand.
From his chair on a brown horse.
It's a horse that speech.
You can feel your blue fur, making it tickle on your nose.
You can smell the <unk> <unk> and you can go back and go into the mouth.
They went on one side and enter your living room.
Because in the room, and doing the maximum use of imagination, imagine Britney <unk>
It's with little clothes, dancing over their center <unk> singing <unk> One More More <unk>
Now let's go back to the kitchen.
The soil has been covered with a yellow building path and from the oven, come to you <unk> the Man of <unk> the <unk> and the Len of "The <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Okay. Open your eyes.
I want to tell you about a peculiar contest that takes every spring in New York City.
It's called the <unk> <unk> of the United States."
I was going to cover this event a few years ago as a journalist, which I suppose, was like the end of a <unk> <unk>
There were several men and a few of these different ages and different habits of sanitation.
They were <unk> hundreds of <unk> numbers just once.
It would take the names of dozens and tens of strangers.
And I have poems poems in just minutes.
<unk> to see who could memorize the order of a deck of <unk>
And I thought, "This is <unk>
These people must be phenomena.
And I started talking to some of the competitors.
This one is a man named Ed Cook who had come from England and has one of the best <unk>
I said, <unk> when you realized you were a <unk>
Ed said, "I am not a wise.
Actually, I have an average memory.
Everybody who involved in this competition says they have normal memory.
We said, "We have been trained to do these miracle acts of memory using some old techniques invented two years ago, in Greece, the same techniques that I used <unk> to memorize their <unk> and that <unk> <unk> used to memorize books <unk>
And my reaction was, <unk> How did I not hear about this <unk>
And we were standing out of the classroom, we were standing out of the competition of competition, and <unk> who is a wonderful English man, although a bit <unk> said to me, <unk> you're an American journalist, <unk>
You know Britney <unk>
And I said, "What? No, why?
Because I'd like to teach Britney <unk> how to memorize the order in a deck of <unk> live on national TV.
That would prove to the world that anybody can do it."
And I said, "Well, I'm not Britney <unk> but maybe you can teach me to me.
I mean, you have to start by something right?"
And that was the beginning of a very strange journey for me.
It ended up spending most of the year next year, not just training my memory, but also <unk> trying to understand how it works, why sometimes it doesn't work and what the potential might be.
I met a lot of really interesting people.
This is a man named <unk>
He's <unk> very probably with the worst memory in the world.
His memory was so bad that I didn't even remember that I had a <unk> problem, it's awesome.
Somebody incredibly tragic, but it was a window that allows us to see what our memory is asking us who we are.
On the other end of the spectrum, I met this man.
This is Kim <unk> He was based on the role of <unk> <unk> in the movie <unk> <unk>
We spent one afternoon together in the public library in Salt Lake City, <unk> scripts <unk> was <unk>
And in return, I was a number of treated about written memory about 2,000 years ago in Latin, in the Middle Ages.
And I learned a lot of really interesting things.
One of the most interesting things I learned is that there was a time where this idea of having memory and disciplined memory was not a thing as rare as it can be like today.
A long time ago, people invest in their memory in providing <unk> their minds.
These techniques have made our modern world, but they've also changed.
We've changed <unk> and I would say that we have changed also cognitive too.
As we already have no need to remember, sometimes it seems like we have forgotten how to do it.
One of the last places on our planet where people are still passionate about this idea of a memory and disciplined memory is this particular competition of memory.
It's actually not so <unk> there are skills like this all over the world.
I was <unk> I wanted to know how these people do.
A few years ago, a group of researchers from University College in London invited a group of memory champions to the lab.
They wanted to tell them that it has some brains in some form of structural or <unk> different from the rest of us?
The answer was, no.
They're smarter than the <unk>
They gave them a <unk> <unk> battery, and the answer was actually, no.
There was a really interesting and meaningful difference between the brains of memory champions and those of the control subjects with the <unk>
When they put them into a MRI machine, it <unk> their brains while <unk> numbers, faces and forms of <unk> they found that in memory champions are <unk> parts of the brain, different to others.
They were <unk> or they seemed <unk> a part of the brain that involves spatial and navigation.
So here's something we can learn from this?
The tournament for <unk> <unk> is driving as a armed race where each year comes up with a new way of remembering more things, more quickly, and then the rest of competitors should get a day.
This is my friend Ben <unk> three times a memory <unk>
On his desk, in front of him, there are 36 <unk> of <unk> <unk> who is about to try to memorize an hour, using a technique that he invented and just <unk>
He used a similar technique to memorize the precise order of <unk> binary digits <unk>
Yeah.
And as there's a lot of ways of remembering things in these <unk> absolutely all the techniques used at the end of a single concept that psychologists call <unk> <unk>
And it illustrates with a elegant paradox known as the ultimate <unk> paradox. He says the following: I tell two people who remember the same word. I'm telling you that there's a man named <unk>
That's your <unk>
And then I ask you, <unk> there's a <unk> <unk>
And when I go later, and I ask them to tell you that word that I told you a <unk>
So what do you do?
The person who was told that his name is <unk> they're unlikely to remember the same word that the person who said their job is <unk>
The same word, different capacity to <unk> that's weird.
What happens here?
Well, the Doha name is it really doesn't mean anything to you. It has no relationship to you.
With all the other memories they dance on their head.
But the word, <unk> We know <unk>
They use white <unk>
They have <unk>
It was good when they come home to work.
You probably have some <unk>
And when we got that word for the first time, we started putting <unk> <unk> for <unk> <unk> at some point later.
One of the most elaborate techniques to do this dates back two years ago, in the Greece <unk>
It's known as the <unk> of <unk>
The story is this: There was a poet called <unk> I attended a <unk>
They had hired him like entertainment, because before, if he wanted to give a very good party, you didn't take a <unk> you would get <unk>
He stood up on the foot, <unk> his memory poem, and it was <unk> and so soon it was, the <unk> <unk>
It was going to be <unk>
But not only killed all of us, but it shattered the bodies that were <unk> <unk>
Nobody could say who was there, nobody could remember where you were sitting still.
And so they could not get <unk>
A tragedy behind the other.
He was standing outside, only surviving in the middle of the rubble, closed the eyes and realized that with the eyes of his mind, I could see where I'd been sitting next to you.
I took the family of his hand <unk> where their loved ones were in the debris.
What we had to pick up at the time is something that we all know more or less <unk> and that is that no matter if we are not good to remember names or phone numbers or instructions by the word of our colleagues, we have visual and spatial memory.
If you tell them that I was going to give you the first 10 words of the story that I just told you about <unk> is very likely that they are very difficult to do it.
But I would bet that if you told them to say who I was sitting on the horse in his <unk> they would be able to <unk>
The idea of the memory of memory is to create this building with the eyes of his mind and <unk> of images with the things that will remember.
This is a advice that comes from over 2,000 years ago, to the first treated of memory, in <unk>
And how does it work?
Let's say you have been invited to the TED stage to give a talk and want to make it memory in the same way that he would have done it, if they had invited him to <unk> years ago.
What you could do is imagine they're at the door of your house.
And to come up with some sort of absolutely ridiculous <unk> crazy image to help them remember that the first thing you want to mention is that competition completely <unk>
And then you can imagine entering your house, and see the <unk> of the <unk> onto Mister <unk>
And that will remind you that they want to introduce your friend Ed <unk>
And then you would see Britney <unk> to remind you that funny anecdote that you want to tell.
And then in the kitchen, and the fourth thing that they talk about would be that strange journey that they made for a whole year, and they have some friends to help you remember it.
This is what speakers <unk> <unk> their <unk> -- not word for word, which is going to confuse you, typical for typical by typical.
In fact, the term <unk> comes from Greek <unk> which means <unk>
It's a <unk> of when people thought about <unk> and in the rhetoric with this kind of spatial terms.
The phrase <unk> <unk> would be like the first place in their memory palazzo in your memory.
I saw this was just fascinating, and I jumped out of it.
I went to some of these memory skills, and I had the idea of writing a long thing about this <unk> <unk>
But there was a problem.
The problem was that a memory competition is a <unk> <unk>
seriously, it's just like seeing a lot of people sitting on <unk> I mean, the most exciting thing that happens is when someone gets <unk>
I'm a journalist and I need to be able to write about something.
I know there are amazing things happening in the minds of these people, but I don't have access.
I realized that if I was going to tell this story, I needed to try to put in his place.
So I began to spend 15 or 20 minutes all the <unk> before I sit down to see the New York Times, just trying to remember something.
Maybe a poem. Or the names of an ancient <unk> school bought in a <unk> market.
And I found that this was fun.
I would never have expected to do it.
It was fun, because it wasn't just to train memory.
What it is actually about doing is better and more and more the ability to create and imagine these <unk> images -- so I can see <unk> <unk> <unk> and hopefully <unk> in the eye of mind.
I was very excited about this.
This is me, using my standard team training for memory.
It's a couple of <unk> and some security goggles with tape covered just two <unk> because the introduction is the worst enemy of one memory memory.
And I ended up coming back to the same contest that I had covered a year before. He had the idea that it could be done in a kind of <unk> <unk> experiment.
I thought this could be good <unk> for all my research.
The problem was that the experiment came out of control.
And I won the <unk> something that I didn't have to happen.
Of course, it's nice to memorize <unk> and phone numbers and <unk> and <unk> but actually this is not the point.
These are just a little bit <unk> <unk> that work.
Because they are based on very basic principles about how the brain works.
And it doesn't need to be building memory <unk> or <unk> <unk> to benefit with a little bit of <unk> about how your mind.
We often talk about people with a great memory as if it was about a gift of <unk> but it's not the case.
Great memories were <unk>
The most basic level, we remember when we pay attention to.
<unk> when we focus on.
The palace of <unk> these memory techniques are just shortcuts.
In fact, they're not even <unk> really.
They work because they make us <unk>
It would be a kind of deep processing, a kind of a complete attention that most of you are not going to go down there.
But the reality is that there is no shortcuts.
That's how things get <unk>
And if there is something that I want to leave you with today is what I <unk> the <unk> I couldn't even remember that I had a memory problem, I left me, which is the notion that life is the sum of our memories.
How much are we willing to lose out of what is already our short existence in the <unk> or <unk> not paying attention to the human being in front of us, who walks on our side are so <unk> that we don't even fall in process in <unk>
I learned from the first hand that there are capacities of amazing amazing memory in all of us.
But if you want to live a living, you must be the kind of person who remembers remember.
Thank you.
Today I'm going to talk to you about the last 30 years of the history of architecture.
It's a lot to cover in 18 minutes.
It's a complex issue, so we will take just a <unk> place in New Jersey.
Because 30 years ago, I am from wheat, Jersey, I was six years old, and I lived there in my parents' house in a town called <unk> and this was my <unk>
In the corner, from my bedroom, I was the bathroom that shared with my sister.
And between my bedroom and the bathroom, there was a balcony that gave the living room.
And there were all my time watching the television so every time I went out of my room to the bathroom, everyone was staring at me, and every time I got up, and I would come back, and I would come back, and I would come back in a towel all of you.
And I was like this.
It was <unk> not and hated it.
I hated that journey, hated that <unk> hated that room and that house.
That's architecture.
All right.
Those emotions that I felt, that's the power of architecture, because architecture is not about mathematics, or <unk> division of areas, but of those connections, emotional connections that we feel in the places that are <unk>
And it's not surprising that we feel like that, because according to the Environmental Protection Agency --  Americans spend 90 percent of their time under roof.
I mean, 90 percent of the time we're around architecture.
That's a lot.
<unk> determines us in ways that we don't even notice.
That makes us a little naive and very, very predictable.
So this means that when I show you a building like this, I know what they <unk> you think about <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And I know you think about it so that we are based on a building built two years ago by the Greeks.
This is a trick.
It's a <unk> that we use architects to create an emotional connection with the ways we build our buildings.
It's an emotional <unk> <unk> we've used this trick for a long, long time.
We used it 200 years ago to build banks.
We used it in the 19th century to build art museums in the 19th century.
And in the 20th century, we use it to build houses.
Look, these stable, stable, stable <unk> in front of the sea, far away from the elements.
This is very, very useful, because building things is terrifying.
It's expensive, it takes a lot of time and it's very complicated.
People who are <unk> the <unk> and governments are always afraid of innovation, and they prefer to use ways that they know they're going to work.
So we find buildings like this.
It's a nice <unk>
It's the Public Library of <unk> which was ended in 2004, in my hometown, and you know, has a <unk> has this round thing, and it has this round thing, and they <unk> what they <unk> is trying to communicate with this <unk> the children, the stock values, the story.
But it doesn't have a lot to do with a library today.
That same year in 2004, the other year, in 2004, the other library, which looks like this.
It's in Seattle.
This library shows how we use media in the digital era.
It's a new kind of public equipment for the city, a place to come up and read and share.
So how is it possible in the same year, in the same country, two buildings, both of the so-called libraries, are so completely different?
And the answer is that architecture works as the beginning of the <unk>
On one side is <unk> architects constantly drive new technologies, new <unk> new solutions for life forms today.
We were going to love and <unk> and <unk> that we got completely from the people.
And all of the black -- you know, you believe that we feel very well, but we're dead within because we have no choice.
We have to go to the other side and go back to connect with those symbols <unk>
So we do that, and we're all happy, but we're all happy, so we started experimenting with <unk> and we started experimenting with the <unk> and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over again, and we've done it in the last 300 years, and of course we've done it in the last 30 years.
Well, 30 years ago I went from the '70s.
The architects were busy experimenting with the so-called <unk>
It's got to do with concrete.
That is a guess.
<unk> small, large-scale scale.
Something really hard.
So we get to the '80s, and we start to incorporate those symbols.
And they will take the power again in the other direction.
We take those ways we know that we like and <unk>
<unk> <unk> and we added a bake <unk> and we use new materials.
I love it.
We don't take <unk>
We took closets <unk> and we turned them into a <unk> which can be <unk> <unk> <unk>
The shapes were <unk> won in audacity and <unk>
<unk> became columns.
<unk> grew up to the size of buildings.
A madness.
But they were the '80s, that was great.
We all spend in commercial centers and moved to the neighborhoods, and there in the suburbs, we could create our own erotic <unk>
Those fantasies could be <unk> to French or Italian or Italian.
Maybe with a <unk> of bread.
This is what happens to the <unk>
This is what happens to the symbols.
They're easy, because instead of creating new spaces, we recreated different memories.
I know very well, and you all know, this is not the <unk>
This is Ohio.
The architects are feeling frustrated and we start making <unk> the concept again in the other direction.
In the 1980s and early '90s, we started experimenting with the so-called <unk>
We have the symbols <unk> we now have new <unk> design techniques -- and we found ourselves with new <unk> a few ways that are <unk> against other forms.
This is an academic, and it's <unk> and it's super <unk>
Usually I will go back in the opposite direction.
But then, something <unk>
In 1997, it opened this building.
It's the <unk> of Frank <unk>
This building changed fundamentally the relationship of the world with architecture.
Paul <unk> said that Bilbao was one of those rare moments when critical and general general, were completely agreed on a building.
The New York Times <unk> this <unk>
<unk> in Bilbao increased a half and a half thousand percent when they finished the building.
So, all of a sudden, everybody wanted one of those <unk> Los Angeles, Seattle, New York, Cleveland, <unk>
Everybody wanted one, and Gehry was everywhere.
He was our first star.
But how is it possible that these wild forms and <unk> how it is possible to become ubiquitous throughout the world?
And it happened, because the media is <unk> around them and quickly learned that those shapes meant culture and tourism.
We've created an emotional reaction with these forms.
They made the main mayors in the world.
So they all believed that if they had these forms, they had culture and tourism.
This phenomenon at the beginning of the new millennium country with other architects architects star.
It happened to <unk> and <unk> and what happened with these few elite architects on the threshold of the new millennium, actually started to go through all architecture, digital media began to increase the speed of information.
Think about it, for example, how do we consume architecture.
A thousand years ago, they would have to have walked up to the next town to see a building.
<unk> <unk> can take a boat, an airplane, can be <unk>
<unk> technology can be seen in the newspapers, on TV, and in the end, we're all photographers of architecture, and the building is transported beyond its physical location.
<unk> is everywhere. It means that the speed of communications finally has reached the speed of architecture.
Because architecture is moving so fast.
It doesn't take much time to think about a building.
It takes a lot of time to build a building, three or four years, and at that time, an architect can design two, eight, or 100 more buildings before we know if which I designed four years ago was a success or not.
Because there has never been good feedback in architecture.
That's how we find buildings like this.
The <unk> was not a two-year-old movement for 20 years.
For 20 years, we were building buildings like this because we had no idea how much the <unk>
That's never going to happen, <unk> because we're at the threshold of the largest revolution in architecture from the invention of <unk> steel or <unk> and it's the media revolution.
My theory is that when you apply the wave to media, it starts to <unk> faster and faster, and to be in both extremes of <unk> and it becomes effectively the difference between innovation and symbol, between us, architects and you, the public.
Now we can make the symbols almost <unk> with emotional burden of something completely new.
I'm going to show you how the system works in a project that my company ended up recently.
We were <unk> to replace this building that was <unk>
This is the center of a town called <unk> in <unk> Island, in New York state.
It's a vacation.
But that meant that two years before the building, the building, was already part of the community. And as the drawings looked exactly into the product -- there was no surprises.
The building came to be part of the community, and that first summer, when people started to come and share it in social media, the building stopped being a building, and it became a kind of communication, because these are not just images of a building, are the images that you made from the building.
And as you use it to tell your story, they become part of the personal narrative -- and that makes it <unk> with collective memory, and when these symbols, we learn.
I mean, we don't need the Greeks how to think about architecture.
We can tell each other what we think about architecture, because digital media has not only changed the relationship between us, but have changed the relationship between us and buildings.
Think about a second in those librarians from <unk>
If that building was built up today, first <unk> the Internet in search of <unk> <unk>
<unk> bombarded with examples of innovation, about what a library.
That's <unk>
<unk> that can lead to the mayor of <unk> to <unk> people and tell them that there is no unique response to what a library is today.
Let's be part of this.
This abundance of solutions gives the freedom to experience.
Everything is different now.
The architects are no longer those mysterious creatures that use words <unk> and weird drawings and one is no longer an <unk> public that doesn't take something that I haven't seen before.
The architects can listen, and you don't leave it for architecture.
That means that the Philippines, <unk> from one style to another, from a movement to another, is irrelevant.
In fact, we can go ahead and find right solutions to the problems facing society.
This is the end of the history of architecture, and it means that the buildings in the morning will be very different from the buildings today.
This means that a public space in the ancient city of <unk> can be only and adapted to the measure of a modern city.
This means that a stadium in Brooklyn can be that, a stadium in Brooklyn, and not a bad imitation historic brick based on ideas of what a <unk>
This means that a few robots will be able to build our buildings, because we will finally be ready for the shapes that will produce.
That means that the buildings were <unk> to the whims of nature and not the opposite.
This means that a garage garage in Miami Beach, Florida, can also serve to make a sport or to <unk> or even you can marry at night.
This means that three architects can dream with swimming on the East Side of New York City, and raise half a million dollars of the connected community around that cause, it's no customer alone.
It means that no building is too small for innovation, like this little <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> like animals that are going to observe.
Because no matter whether it's a cow or a robot who builds our buildings.
It doesn't matter how we built, what it matters is what we build.
The architects already know how to make buildings more <unk> smarter and more kind.
We've been waiting for all of you.
Finally, we are no longer <unk>
Find an architect, <unk> and work together to make better buildings, better cities, for a better world, because there's a lot on play.
Buildings not only reflect our society, but they give way to the most <unk> spaces and local libraries the homes where we go to our children, and the way to the bathroom.
Thank you very much.
This is my <unk> <unk>
It just turned a year and started walking.
And it does it in that great great way of the children of a year, <unk> as if your body is moving too fast for her legs.
It's totally <unk>
And one of the things that I like to do for the moment is to look at the mirror.
She really loves his reflection.
<unk> and <unk> and gives themselves these great kisses and <unk>
It's beautiful.
Apparently, all his friends do this and my mom tells me that I used to do it. And it made me think, when couple of you do this?
How is it that we are not very happy with our <unk>
Because they don't like it.
Every month, 10,000 people are looking at Google "I'm <unk>
This is <unk> it's 13 years old, and lives in <unk>
And as any teenager, you just want to be dear and fit in.
It's Sunday at night.
It's preparing for next week in school.
It has a little bit scared, it's a little confused because, even though his mom tells her all the time that it's beautiful, every day in school, someone tells him it's ugly.
Between what his mom tells him and what his friends, or fellow members of the school told him, you don't know who you believe.
So a video of it, she puts him on YouTube, and he asks others for you to leave a <unk> "I'm nice or I'm <unk>
Well, until now, <unk> has received over 13,000 comments.
Some of these are so <unk> that it doesn't even deserve to think about them.
We talk about a normal healthy teenager and running these answers on one of the stages of their most emotionally <unk>
Thousands of people are publishing movies like this, mostly teenage girls trying to communicate this way.
But what is it doing to do this?
Well, adolescents are almost never alone.
They are under pressure of being online and available all the time, talking to the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- this never ends.
Never before we've been as connected in a continuous way, so so young as young people.
As a mother said, "It's like a party in his room all the <unk>
There's just no privacy.
And the social pressures on the hand are <unk>
This environment, of being always connected, is <unk> our children to <unk> based on the number of subjects they have and the kinds of comments that they do.
There is no divide between a life online and real life.
It's really hard to know the differences between what's real or what it isn't.
And also, it's very hard to know the difference between what is authentic and what is <unk>
What is the biggest thing in somebody's life in front of what normal is normal in a <unk> context.
And where are you looking for <unk>
Well, you can see the kind of images that are <unk> from the news of girls now.
<unk> <unk> still <unk> our <unk>
The <unk> technique is now one routine.
And trends like, <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
For those of the <unk> <unk> it means <unk>
These trends are associated with women in popular culture today.
It's not hard to see what young people want?
But the kids are not immune to this.
It's like the <unk> stars of the sport, and the singers <unk>
But what is the problem with all of this?
Well, we probably want our kids to grow healthy and be individuals that are very <unk>
But in a culture obsessed with the image, we're teaching our kids to spend more time and mental effort to look at the price of every other aspect of their identity.
Things like their relationships, the development of their physical capabilities and their studies and other aspects start to suffer.
Six in 10 girls would rather do something because they think they don't look nice enough.
These are not <unk> activities.
These are fundamental activities for its growth as human beings and how human beings encourage society and the field of labor development.
31 percent, almost one of three teenagers are not interested in the debates of class.
One in five aren't attending class at all over the days when you don't feel comfortable about it.
And in the season of tests, if you don't think you're good enough -- specifically if you don't think you're good enough -- you get a less note to the average of your fellow partners who don't care about that as appearance.
And this phenomenon has widespread in Finland, U.S. and China.
And it turns out of what they actually weigh these young people.
So to be clear, of course, we're talking about how you see you, not how you really are.
The low self-esteem on your body is <unk> the academic performance.
And it's also <unk> health.
<unk> with little self-esteem are doing less physical activity, they eat fewer fruits and vegetables, participate in more diets. They can take them to a food mess in it.
They have low self-esteem.
They're more easily <unk> by the people around them and are at greater risk of depression.
And we think it's all about this because of what they make decisions more than the consumption of alcohol and the drugs, diets.
The pursuit of the perfect body is pushing the health care system, and our government costs billions of dollars every year.
And we're not <unk>
Women who believe they are overweight again, regardless of whether they have no greater <unk>
17 percent of women don't present to a job interview in one day where they don't feel safe with the way you see.
Think for a moment in what this is doing to our economy.
If we could overcome this, what would that <unk>
We have this potential for each of us.
But how do we do that?
Well, speaking, it doesn't take you too far.
It's not enough.
If you really want to change things, you have to do something.
And we've learned that there are three key <unk> The first is we need to instill trust in their own body.
We have to help our teens develop strategies to overcome the pressure of perfect images and build their self-esteem.
The good news is that there are many programs available to do it.
The bad news is that most of these don't work.
I was very surprised when I learned that a lot of <unk> programs without realizing it, you know, <unk> the situation.
So we need to make sure that the program that our children are not only going to have a positive impact, but also a lasting impact.
And research studies show that the best programs focus on six key <unk> The first is the influence of family, friends and relationships.
These six aspects are starting to be crucial for anyone who is willing to provide an education on your body to work.
An education is fundamental -- but tackling this problem requires each of us to take charge in the issue and be a better model for women and girls in our own lives.
It's challenging the current status of how women are seen, and I mentioned in our circles.
It's not good to tell you with the contribution of our politicians on your hair or the size of their <unk> or <unk> that determination or success of an Olympic athlete depends on the fact that it's not a big beauty.
We need to start judge people by what they are, not as they see.
We all can start by taking responsibility for the kind of images and comments we published in our social networks.
We can tell people based on their effort and their actions and not in their appearance.
And let me ask you: When was the last time you would get a <unk>
In short, we have to work together as communities, as governments and as companies, to really change our culture, so that our children grow to our children to grow the <unk> of diversity, diversity, <unk>
We need to put people who are actually making the difference in a <unk>
by making a difference in the real world, let's make them be the ones that go out on the big screen because we just create a different world.
A world where our children are free to become the best version of themselves, where the way they believe you see you are never going to be the ones who are, or to reach what they want in their lives.
Think about what this can mean for somebody in their lives.
Who are in mind?
He <unk>
He <unk>
He <unk>
He <unk> his <unk>
Could it be just the woman who is two car seats -- what would it mean for her if he was released from that <unk> voice in his interior, that he was going to be able to have long legs, <unk> a more flat, <unk> <unk>
What would it mean for her if we were going to do this and would say the potential of that way?
Right now, the obsession of our culture with the images is holding us all together.
But we would give our kids the truth.
<unk> that the way you see you is just a part of your identity, and that the truth is that we love them for those who are and what they do, and because they make us feel.
It would take your self-esteem into the <unk> of our schools.
We change each one of us, the way we talk about and compare to other people.
And we work together as a community, from small groups to governments, so that the small <unk> of a year of today, becoming safe agents of themselves tomorrow.
So let's do it.
On the five of November 1990, a gentleman named <unk> <unk> walked into a hotel in Manhattan and killed the rabbi <unk> <unk> the leader of the League of Defense <unk>
<unk> initially was able to get a prisoner for other charges -- in the company of others, started planning for attacks at about 12 icons in New York, including <unk> <unk> and the United Nations.
Fortunately, those plans were <unk> by an informant in the FBI.
Sadly, the bomb of 1993 in the World Trade Center couldn't be <unk>
Later on, I would be convicted of his participation in that <unk>
<unk> <unk> is my father.
I was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in 1983, being an engineer <unk> with an American mother <unk> elementary school mastery of the two made all possible for me to give me an happy childhood, <unk>
Only when I was seven years old, our family started to change.
My father taught me a form of Islam, that very few, even most Muslims will meet.
By experience I saw that when people take time to interact, it doesn't require a lot to want to want to wish the same things in life.
However, in all of religion, in all human group, there are always a small fraction of people who are <unk> so <unk> to their convictions that think that you have to use all of the possible means that everyone lived in the way that everybody lived like them.
A few months before I arrest he sat with me and explained that in the last weekends, he and some friends, had been going to be training in Long Island, to practice.
He told me that I would go with him the next day.
We got to the <unk> shot <unk> which, without knowing our group, I was talking to the FBI.
When I got <unk> my father helped me hold my <unk> on my shoulder and explained to me how to point to about 30 meters.
That day, with the last bullet that he shot at the little little orange light on the target and to surprise all of us, especially me, all the goal was on fire.
My uncle went back to the other and Arabic, he said <unk> <unk>
Of such a father, that child.
All of all, the comment produced a lot of laughter. But just a few years later I understood what they were so funny.
Did you see on me, the same level of destruction that my father could <unk>
Those people later would be committed to putting a stick with 700 pounds of explosives in the underground parking lot of the northern tower of the North Trade Center, causing a explosion that killed six people and hurt other 1,000.
I admired those men.
He called them <unk> which means uncle.
When I turned 19, I had moved 20 times. That instability during my childhood was not allowed to make a lot of them.
Every time I started to feel comfortable about someone now was time to pack and go to another city.
As I was always my own new side of the class that was often the victim of <unk>
<unk> secret <unk> my identity to avoid being the white -- but it will be the new of the quiet class, quiet and <unk> was enough <unk>
So most of the time I spent in home reading books, watching TV or playing video games.
For these reasons I did not have social skills, to put it off, to grow under <unk> I wasn't prepared for the real world.
And I was raised opera judge people, based on indicators <unk> like race or religion.
So how could I open the eyes?
One of the first experiences that they put to test my thinking was during presidential elections in 2000.
In a <unk> program where I was involved in the National Convention, <unk> in Philadelphia.
My group was <unk> in the theme of juvenile violence as I had been a <unk> victim -- almost my entire life, was something that I felt a lot of passion.
The members of this group came from different <unk>
One day, at the end of the <unk> I discovered that one of the kids who had made friendship, was Jewish age.
It took several days to go out of light this detail and realized that there was no <unk> between the two.
I had never had a Jewish friend and frankly I was very proud to have to beat the barrier that my whole life had made me believe was <unk>
Another crucial moment came when I got a summer job at Bush <unk> an amusement park.
I found myself with people of all kinds of beliefs and cultures, that experience turned out in the development of my character.
The whole life had been taught me that <unk> was a sin and by extension, all gay people were bad <unk>
By chance, I had the opportunity to work with gay actors there, in a show, and I could see that several of them were the <unk> and least critical that I had seen in life.
Having been a kid, I developed a sense of empathy for the suffering of others, but it wasn't easy for me to treat people rather exactly how I would have to be treated.
So I was able to contrast the stereotypes that I had taught me as a child, with the experience of interaction in real life.
I don't know what it is to be homosexual but I know what is being judged by something beyond my control.
Then he came the <unk> <unk>
All night, Jon Stewart made me <unk> honest with my <unk> and helped me see that race of the people, religion or sexual orientation, they have nothing to do with character.
In many ways, he became my figure <unk> at a moment when I was desperately <unk>
And sometimes, the inspiration can come from the unexpected. And that a Jewish comedian had had a better influence in my life than my own father, <unk> wasn't in no avail.
One day I had a conversation with my mother about how I was changing my way of thinking about it, and she told me something to keep in my heart for always, while he's alive.
She looked at me with my eyes tired of someone who's had enough <unk> and said, "I'm tired of <unk>
At that moment I realized how much negative energy you need to keep that hate in your inside.
My real name is not <unk> <unk>
It changed when my family decided to break the relationship to my father and start a new life.
So why do I decided to go out and put on a possible risk?
Well, it's simple.
I've done it because I hope that someone, one day, who is trying to lead to violence, I can hear my story and understand that there is a better way, than even though I was given to this violent ideology and <unk> I didn't get to get myself <unk>
On the contrary, I decided to use my experience to fight terrorism and against prejudice.
I do it by the victims of terrorism and their loved loved pain and the losses that terrorism has produced in their lives.
By the victims of terrorism to talk about those acts of sense, like rejection to my father's actions.
With this <unk> I put myself here as a proof that violence is not inherent to any religion or race -- that children don't have to follow the roads of their parents.
I'm not my father.
Thank you.  Thank you all.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.
At this point, there's a film that projects in their minds.
It's an amazing movie <unk>
It's in 3D and it has <unk> sound that you hear and see right now, but that's just the beginning.
Your movie has <unk> taste and texture.
It feels your body, your pain, your hunger, your pleasure.
It has emotions, anger and happiness.
It has memories, as moments of your childhood that you project in front of your eyes.
And it has constantly a superimposed voice, in your conscious thought.
The heart of the movie is you who experience everything online.
This film is your conscience, the subject of the experience of the mind and the world.
Consciousness is one of the fundamental truths of the human being.
Each one of us is conscious.
We all have an internal film to you, you and you.
There's nothing to do more directly.
At least, I know that I have an awareness of it.
I have no certainty that you are aware of.
Consciousness is also the reason to live.
If we weren't aware of, nothing in our lives would make sense or value.
But at the same time, it's the most mysterious phenomenon of the universe.
Why are we <unk>
Why do we have these films <unk>
Why are we not just the robots that we are getting to produce results without experiencing the movie <unk>
At this point, nobody knows the answers to those questions.
I suggest that to integrate consciousness to science, you need some radical ideas.
Some people say it's impossible for a science of consciousness.
Now science, by nature, is objective to change.
The consciousness, by nature, is <unk>
So there can never be a science of consciousness.
Because for almost all of the 20th century, I will tell you that vision.
psychology was studying corporate behavior -- the neuroscience was studying the <unk> brain, but nobody mentioned consciousness.
Even 30 years ago, when TED started, there were very few scientific jobs about consciousness.
<unk> 20 years ago, everything started to change.
<unk> like Francis and physicists like Roger <unk> said, <unk> is the time for the science <unk> <unk>
And since then, there was a real bang, a snapshot of the scientific work of consciousness.
And this work was fantastic. It was great.
But it also has fundamental limitations to the moment.
The center of the science of consciousness in the recent years was the pursuit of <unk> correlations between some areas of the brain and some states of consciousness.
We saw some of this guy at the fantastic work that Nancy <unk> a few minutes ago.
Now we understand a lot better, for example, areas of the brain that are related to the conscious experience of seeing faces or feeling happy or feeling happy.
But this is still a science of <unk>
It's not a science of <unk>
We know that these areas of the brain are related to certain kinds of conscious experience, but we don't know why.
I'd like to explain that by saying that this kind of work of neuroscience answers some questions that we want to explain consciousness. The questions about what they do certain areas of the brain and what they are <unk>
But in a sense, those are the easy problems.
<unk> to the <unk>
There's really no trouble with consciousness.
Well, it doesn't go through the real mystery of this <unk> why all physical process in the brain has to be accompanied by consciousness?
Why is there an internal movie <unk>
At this point, we can't understand it.
And you can say, let's give it a few years to the neuroscience.
It's going to become another emerging phenomenon like <unk> like <unk> like life, and we're going to find explanation.
<unk> are all cases of emerging behaviors, how they operate <unk> how they work, how they are <unk> how they behave and <unk> the living organisms -- they're all questions about how they work.
That could be applied to the human brain to explain some behaviors and the functions of the human brain as a <unk> phenomenon, how do we talk about, how do we play <unk> they're all questions about behavior.
But when it comes to consciousness, questions about behavior are in the easy problems.
But the hard problem is the question of why it is that all of the behavior is that all of the behavior is actually accompanied by a <unk> experience.
And here's the standard paradigm of <unk> the standard paradigm of neuroscience, actually doesn't have a lot to say.
I'm a <unk> scientific <unk>
I want a scientific theory of <unk> that works. For a long time, I would beat my head against the wall looking for a theory of consciousness in pure terms of physical terms.
But at the end, I came to the conclusion that it didn't work for a lot of <unk> reasons.
I think we're going to focus on this point.
We have a chain of wonderful, wonderful explanations -- we get used to this, the physics explains chemistry, the chemistry explains biology, biology explains biology, explains a psychology.
But consciousness doesn't seem to fit into this scheme.
On the one hand, it's a fact that we are aware of.
On the other, we don't know how to hold that idea to our scientific view of the world.
I think that consciousness, right now, is kind of a <unk> something that we need to integrate to our view of the world, but we don't know even how.
With an anomaly like this, you can need radical ideas, I think we need ideas that we need to be thought at the beginning of <unk> before we can deal with consciousness in a scientific way.
There are some possibilities for those crazy ideas.
My friend Dan Dennett, who's here has one.
Her crazy idea is that there is no such problem that is difficult to consciousness.
All the idea of the internal subjective movie includes a kind of illusion or confusion.
In fact, what you have to do, is to explain the functions of the brain -- the behaviors of the brain -- and you study everything that needs <unk>
Well, more power for him.
That's the kind of radical idea that we need to explore if we want to have a theory of consciousness purely <unk> based on the brain.
At the same time, for me, and for many others, that vision is pretty close to simply deny that the observation of consciousness is satisfying.
But I go in a different direction.
In the time that -- I want to explore two crazy ideas that I think can be <unk>
The first crazy idea is that consciousness is fundamental.
physicists sometimes take some aspects of the universe as <unk> space, and the mass.
<unk> laws that are fundamental to <unk> as the laws of gravity or quantum mechanics.
These laws and fundamental properties don't explain in terms of any more basic.
Instead, they find principles, and that's where the world is constructed.
Sometimes the list of the fundamental is <unk>
In the 19th century, China discovered that you can't explain the electric phenomena in terms of fundamental concepts <unk> space, time, <unk> laws of Newton. And then <unk> the basic laws of <unk> and <unk> the electrical charge as a fundamental concept that those laws will happen.
I think that's the situation that we find ourselves with consciousness.
If you can't explain consciousness in terms of fundamental ideas -- space space, time, they charge it, then for a matter of logic, you have to put the list.
The most natural thing would be <unk> the same as a fundamental brick of nature.
This doesn't mean that suddenly it's not the object of science.
It opens the way to <unk> scientifically.
So what we need is to study the fundamental laws that govern consciousness, the laws that connect consciousness with other core concepts -- space, the mass, the mass, physical processes.
The physicists sometimes say we want to have fundamental laws that we can put them into a <unk>
The situation of consciousness is something like this.
We want to find fundamental laws that we can put them into a t-shirt.
We still don't know what laws are, but that's what we're after.
The second crazy idea is that consciousness can be universal.
Every system can have a degree of consciousness.
This vision is sometimes called <unk> <unk> by mind, every system is conscious, not only humans -- dogs, the mice, or even the microbes from Rob <unk> the elementary particles.
Even a <unk> has some degree of consciousness.
The idea is not that photons are smart to be smart or <unk>
It's not that a <unk> can be full of distress when you think about saying, "Oh, always traveling at the speed of light.
I can never slow down and smell the <unk>
No, no.
But the thought is that perhaps photons can have some element of crude feeling, there are some key precursor to consciousness.
This may sound a little crazy for you.
How would someone think about something so crazy?
Part of this comes from the first crazy idea, and that consciousness is a fundamental thing.
If it's fundamental -- like space, time and mass, it's natural to assume that it can also be universal, like others.
It's also worth noticing that even though the idea seems to us, it's much less for the people of different cultures, where the human mind seems to be a continuum with nature.
A deeper reason comes from the idea that perhaps the simplest and powerful way to find fundamental laws that <unk> thinking with the physical process, is <unk> awareness with information.
Whenever there is information processing, there's consciousness.
<unk> of <unk> complex -- as in a human being, physical awareness.
<unk> of simple information, simple awareness.
Something really exciting is that in the recent years, a neuroscientist, <unk> neuroscientist, took this kind of theory and developed it <unk> with mathematical methods.
It has a mathematical measure of information integration which is called <unk> which measures the degree of information integrated into a system.
And it's supposed to have to do with consciousness.
So in a human brain, there's an incredible degree of information integration of information, a lot of consciousness.
In a mouse there is an average degree of information integration of information, the same kind of significant, degree of awareness.
But when you get to the <unk> microbes, particles, the degree of <unk> <unk>
The level of integration of information, but it's not zero either.
In <unk> theory, there will still be a different level of <unk>
In fact this is a fundamental law of <unk> high degree of consciousness.
Moreover, another reason is that <unk> can help us integrate consciousness into physical world.
<unk> and philosophers have observed that physics is curiously abstract.
It <unk> the structure of reality using a lot of equations, but it doesn't talk to us about reality underlying it.
As Stephen Hawking explains where the fire comes from?
From the view, the physical equations can be released as they are, but you can use it to describe the flow of consciousness.
That's what physicists do basically describe the flow of consciousness.
According to this vision, consciousness is the one that puts fire in the equations.
In that vision, consciousness is not outside of the physical world as a kind of <unk>
It's right there at the center.
This is vision, I think, <unk> vision has the potential to <unk> our relationship to nature, and it can have pretty serious social consequences.
Some can be <unk>
I used to think that I shouldn't eat anything that I had to eat consciousness, then I should be a <unk>
If you're a <unk> and you take that vision, you'll have a lot of hunger.
I think it tends to think about this, this tends to transform your vision, while what matters in ethical terms, and moral <unk> is not both the fact that the consciousness, but its importance and complexity.
It's also natural to ask for consciousness in other systems, like computers.
What about the artificial intelligence system in Samantha <unk>
It's <unk>
According to the vision of <unk> information, she has a complicated information processing in so that the answer is yes, if it's conscious.
If this is right -- these are really serious ethical problems about the ethic of development of smart computers of smart computers and the ethics of <unk>
Finally, you can ask for the awareness of the collective collective -- the planet.
Canada has its own consciousness?
Or at a local level, an integrated group as the audience at a TED group, and right now we have a collective consciousness -- an internal film for this whole group of TED, different from the internal movies of each of the <unk>
I don't know the answer to that question, but I think at least it's a question that has to be serious.
So this <unk> <unk> is a radical vision, and I don't know if it's correct.
I'm actually safer by the first crazy idea, that consciousness is a fundamental thing, than the second thing is universal.
The vision raises a lot of questions, and many challenges, like, how those bits of thinking contribute to the kind of complex consciousness that we know and love it.
If we can answer those questions, then I think we're going on the right way to a theory of serious awareness.
If not, well, it's probably the hardest problem of science and philosophy.
We can't wait to solve the night in the morning.
But I think we will finally find it.
Understanding consciousness is the real key, I think, to understand the universe and to understand ourselves.
Maybe we just need the crazy idea.
Thank you.
I grew up in a small rural village in Victoria.
He had a very normal profile, one under the profile of education.
I went to school, I was fascinated with my friends, and I was fascinated with my younger sisters.
Everything was very normal.
And when I was 15 years old, a member of my community came up to my parents because I wanted to make it for a community reward.
And my parents said, "Well, that's very nice, but there is a fantastic problem.
She actually hasn't <unk> <unk>  And they were right.
I went to school, and I had good grades. After school, I had a under the <unk> of my mother, and spent a lot of time looking at the <unk> the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
Yeah, yeah. What a contradiction.
But they were right.
I didn't do anything that was extraordinary at all.
Nothing that can be considered if we took the disability out of the equation.
Years later, being in the second part of teaching at a high school in <unk> just after about 20 minutes in the middle of the 11 <unk> a guy raised his hand and said, "Hey, when will you give your <unk>
And I said, "What do you do?"
Well, I had been talking about law enforcement for a good 20 minutes.
And he said, "You know, your speech <unk>
When people in the wheels, they talk about things to do at school?"
Usually in the classroom.
And it was when I realized, this child had had experiences with disability as an inspiration.
And we don't are. And it's not the boy, I mean, that's true for many of us.
For us, people with disability are not our teachers or our doctors or our <unk>
We are not real people. We're there for inspiring.
And in fact, I'm on this stage <unk> what I do in this wheelchair and you probably are waiting for you to say, right?  Yes.
Well, ladies and gentlemen, I'm afraid.
I'm not here for <unk>
I'm here to tell you that we lied to the disability.
Yes, they have sold us the lie that disability is something -- <unk> A capital <unk>
It's a bad thing and living with a disability makes you remarkable.
It's not a bad thing and it doesn't get to make you remarkable.
And over the last few years, we've been able to spread even more of this lie through social media.
You may have seen images like this: "The only disability in life is a bad <unk>
Or this <unk> "Your excuse is <unk>
Or this <unk> "Before <unk> <unk>
These are just a couple of examples, but there's a lot of them.
You may have seen one of the girl without the hands of a drawing with a pencil held by the mouth.
You may have seen a child running with carbon fiber.
And there's a lot of these images, which are what we call <unk>
And I use the porn porn term -- because they would take a group of people for the benefit of another group of people.
So in this case, <unk> the disabled people who have no disability.
The purpose of these images is <unk> <unk> so we can see them and think, "Well, for very bad to be my life, it could be worse.
I could be that person.
But if you're that person?
I've lost the number of times that I've been dealing with strange <unk> to express that I am brave or a source of inspiration, and this would happen before my work had a public profile.
It was as if I was excited to get up in the morning and remember my own name.  And this is <unk>
And these images, those images are attached to people with disability to the benefit of people with no disability.
They're there for you to see them and think that things are not so bad for you, or to put your concerns in perspective.
And life as a disabled person is really hard.
It was a few things.
But the things that we are not the things that you can think of.
They're not relative to our bodies.
I use the term <unk> <unk> deliberately because I was <unk> by the so-called social model of disability, that tells us that we are more disabled because of the society that we live than because of our bodies or diagnosis.
So I've lived in this body for a long time.
I'm very excited about it.
The things I need to do, and I've learned to get the best of their ability as well as you do, and that's what happens to the children of those pictures as well.
They're not doing anything out of the common.
They're just using their bodies getting the best of their ability.
So, it's really fair to <unk> in the way we do that, by sharing those <unk>
When people say, "You're a source of <unk> it tells you how a compliment.
And I know why that happens.
It's because of the lie, because they've been sold this lie that disability makes us <unk>
And honestly, it doesn't do it.
And I know what you're thinking.
I'm here <unk> the inspiration, and you think, "My God, <unk> you're not at times inspired by something else?
And actually, I know I am.
<unk> of other people with disability at all time.
However, I don't realize that I'm more lucky than them.
<unk> that this is a great idea to use <unk> <unk> to collect the things that they fall down --  <unk> the clever trick of how to load the battery cell phone on the battery battery.
Great.
We learn from the strength and the resistance of others, not against our bodies and our <unk> but against a world that <unk> and <unk>
I really believe that that lie that they have sold us about disability is the biggest <unk>
It makes us hard life.
And that quote: "The only disability in life is a bad <unk> the reason that that's lie is because it's not true because of the social model of disability.
A lot of smiles a lot of smiles has never done that it becomes a <unk>
Never.   <unk> in front of a television screen won't make the subtitles for people who are <unk>
Not a lot of people in the middle of a bookstore and <unk> a positive attitude to turn all those books into the <unk>
It's just not going to happen.
I really want to live in a world where disability is not exception, but the norm.
I want to live where a six-year-old girl sitting in his bedroom watching <unk> the <unk> <unk> not considered to be in a chair.
I want to live in a world where we don't have so low expectations of the people with disability that we are standing up by coming up from bed and remember our names for the morning.
I want to live in a world where we value the real achievement.
The disability doesn't make us <unk> but question what you think to know about what it does.
Thank you.
What do you have to do with augmented reality and professional reality with <unk>
And what is the average speed of a <unk> without <unk>
Unfortunately, today I just answer one of those questions, so please, not <unk>
When people think about <unk> you think about <unk> <unk> and in Tom <unk> <unk> the hands in the air, but reality augmented is not science fiction.
<unk> reality is something that will happen in our days and happen because we have the tools to do that, and people need to know because reality will change our lives as much as the Internet and mobile phones.
So how did we get to reality <unk>
The first step, is what I'm wearing <unk> Google Glass.
I'm sure many of you are familiar with them.
What you may not know is that Google <unk> are a device that allows them to see what I see.
It will allow them to experience what is a professional <unk> in the field.
Right now, the only way to be in the field is that I try to <unk>
I have to use words.
I have to create a framework that you <unk> with your imagination.
We can use Google Glass, under a helmet and knowing what is running through the field of play to 160 <unk> blood hitting the ears.
We can know that a man is a little 110 pound man to get us trying to do it with all their being.
I've been there and I assure you that it's not nice.
So let's take some videos to show you what is using the Google <unk> under the helmet, and give them an idea of that.
Unfortunately, it's not images of <unk> practices because the idea of the emerging technology of the emerging technology is a submarine up to the surface.
So let's look at a video.
Chris <unk> Come on.
It's horrible to be <unk>
A little bit of a moment.
<unk>
Go!
Chris <unk> As you can see, it's a <unk> of what is being <unk> in the field of football, from the perspective of the <unk>
You may have noticed that we need people, the rest of the team.
We have a video of them, dozens of Washington University.
<unk> <unk> Mice -- Mice <unk>
Blue eight, Blue <unk> Go!
Chris <unk> This is a little bit more like feeling in the field, but it has nothing to do with being in the <unk>
<unk> want that experience.
The fans want to be in the field, being their favorite players and you have asked me on YouTube and in <unk> you can see from the angle of a <unk>
or a <unk>
We want to experience that."
Once we have that experience with <unk> and Google Glass, how do we get <unk> how we take it to the next level?
We took it to that level using something called <unk> <unk> which probably many of you already know.
The Rift <unk> has been described as the most realistic reality device ever created, and it's not cheap.
And I'm going to show you why, with this video.
Man: Oh, Oh.
No, no, no! Don't want to keep <unk> No!
Oh, my God! Ah!
CK: That is the experience of a man on a Russian mountain, <unk> for his life.
What will be the experience of a fan when you go through a video of climbing <unk> crossing the line, <unk> from a <unk> with the arm before we run and make a <unk> What will be the experience of a fan
When it can be <unk> running through the <unk> he pulled the ball into the network?
What will be your experience when you go from a mountain to over 100 <unk> like a <unk> <unk>
Maybe <unk> <unk> <unk>
But this is not still <unk>
It's just virtual reality, <unk>
How do we get the reality <unk> <unk>
<unk> reality augmented reality, when the <unk> the <unk> and the owners see the information that people want to see and think, "How do we use this to improve our <unk>
How do we use it to win <unk>
Because they always use technology to win.
They like to win. They give them money.
So, here's a brief review about technology in <unk>
In <unk> the Baltimore <unk> had a <unk> to his <unk> <unk> to play faster.
They won the Super Bowl that year.
Other teams decided to be <unk>
More people saw the party because it was more exciting, faster.
In 1994, the <unk> put radios on the <unk> of the <unk> and then in the defenses.
They had more viewers because it was faster, more fun.
In <unk> imagine that they are a player going back to their group and see their next move shown in front of you, in a plastic bombsight that they carry on. You don't have to worry about forget a <unk>
or <unk> the strategy.
They just go out the field and react.
And the coaches want to do it, because if you don't follow their instructions, they lose games, and they hate to lose <unk>
If you lose parties as a coach.
And they don't want that.
But augmented reality is not just a <unk> <unk>
<unk> reality is a way to collect information and use it in real time to improve your game.
How would you do?
Well, a very simple choice is to have a camera on every corner of the stadium having a view from the high of the people that are down.
You also get information from the <unk> and the <unk> something that is already working on.
And all of that information is sent to your <unk>
The good teams will know <unk>
The bad ones will have the information <unk>
This is <unk> the good teams of bad guys.
So your computer team is going to be as important as your <unk> and data analysis to stop being alone.
It's also to <unk> Who would have <unk>
So what would it be in the country?
Imagine that it's the <unk>
You get a ball.
<unk> on a open receiver -- suddenly, a <unk> on the left side of your bombsight -- you will tell you that a defense behind you is going to kill you typically, but the <unk> system will be <unk>
It <unk> to the protection.
Another <unk> you know that there's a open receiver there.
<unk> <unk> but <unk>
And the ball loses the trajectory.
You don't know where the land. But the receptor sees in their bombsight -- a <unk> area and it can change the race.
<unk> <unk> <unk> runs and <unk>
The public public and fans have followed the move from every angle.
This is something that creates a massive emotion in the game.
I'm going to make lots of people you see it, because people want to live that experience.
<unk> want to be in the field.
They want to be your favorite player.
<unk> reality is part of the sport because it's too profitable to be.
But what I ask you is, we want this to be the only use of reality <unk>
We're going to use it just like bread and <unk> like our entertainment entertainment.
Because I think we can use it for something else.
I think we can use augmented reality to encourage empathy between human beings, to show someone what is literally being in the other person's place.
We know what this technology is worth for <unk>
It generates billions of revenue a year.
But how much is this technology worth in the classroom to a teacher in the classroom trying to show a <unk> what their actions are from the perspective of the <unk>
How much is that this technology is worth in Uganda or Russia trying to show the world how it is being <unk>
How much is that for a <unk> <unk> or Neil <unk> <unk> trying to inspire a generation of children to think more in space and science rather than notes and <unk>
Ladies and gentlemen, reality augmented reality.
The questions that we do, the decisions we take and the challenges we face -- <unk> as always, from us.
Thank you.
Recently I was <unk> after 23 years of service.
Most of those 23 years was the country <unk> the southern end of the County <unk> which includes the <unk> <unk>
The bridge is a <unk> structure, which is known for its beautiful views of San Francisco, the Pacific Ocean and his inspirational architectural style.
Unfortunately, it's also an imam for the death -- being one of the most used places in the world.
The <unk> Bridge was opened in <unk>
Joseph <unk> who's been able to build the bridge, said that, "The bridge is practically <unk>
suicide from the bridge is not practical and <unk>
But from its openness, over 1,600 people have jumped on their death from that bridge.
Some people believe that traveling between the two towers will bring them to another dimension, this bridge has been <unk> as such, so that every single one from it releases away from all your concerns and pain, and the waters that go under <unk> your soul.
But let me tell you that happens when the bridge is used to commit suicide.
After one every free of four to five seconds, the body hits the water about 120 miles an hour.
The impact breaks bones, the bone, some of which will be vital organs.
Most people die in the impact.
Those who don't normally fall in <unk> water and then <unk>
I don't think that the one that is going to be a suicide method will notice the <unk> death of the <unk>
This is the wire.
Except, the two towers, there are 32 inches of steel into the bridge.
This is where most people are in order to take their life.
I can tell you for experience that once the person is on that edge, and at the darkest time, it's very hard to bring us back.
I took this picture last year while this young man spoke with an official contemplating his life.
I want to tell you with joy that we were successful on that day to bring her back into the <unk>
When I started working on the bridge, we didn't have formal training.
So let's take it to channel the way through these calls.
This was not just a bad service to those of us who were <unk> the death but the officials as well.
We've come a long way since then.
Today, veterans and psychologists train the new official people.
This is Jason <unk>
I met him at the age of July July last year by getting a call from a possible subject subject to be suicide in the <unk>
<unk> and when I came here, I looked at Jason talking with a official <unk> <unk>
Jason only 32 years old, and I had flown up here from New Jersey.
In fact, there were flown up here two times since New Jersey to try to kill me from this bridge.
After about an hour talking to <unk> we asked us if we knew the story of the box of <unk>
<unk> the mythology was <unk> <unk> created <unk> and sent it to the Earth with a box, and he said, <unk> never open that <unk>
Well, one day, curiosity could more than <unk> and she opened the box.
And she came out with <unk> <unk> and all kinds of <unk> against the man.
The only good thing in the box was hope.
So Jason said, "What if you open the box and there's no <unk>
He was stopped, and he leaned on the right, and he left.
This kind of smart and intelligent guy in New Jersey just had to take my life.
I talked to the parents of Jason that night, and I guess when I was talking to them, he didn't seem to be ringing very well, because the next day, the John rabbi was called me to see how I was.
The parents of Jason had the <unk>
<unk> damage suicide affect a lot of people.
I put you these questions: What would you do if a member of your family, a friend or someone loved to be <unk>
What do you do?
Tell me what to say?
In my experience, there is not only to speak, but you need to listen.
Listening to understand.
Don't you <unk> or tell the person you know how to feel, because they probably won't.
Just being there, you can be the inflection point that they need.
If you think that someone is <unk> you're not afraid of <unk> and asking the question.
One way to ask you the question is, do you think about similar circumstances have thought about finishing your life, you've had these <unk>
<unk> the person in front of them can save life and be the inflection point for them.
Other signs to <unk> despair, believe that things are terrible and they're never going to <unk> <unk> believe that there's nothing that you can do to the <unk> social isolation, and a lost interest in life.
I came up with this talk just a couple of days, and I got an email from a lady and I would like to read your letter.
She lost his son on January 19, this year, and he wrote to me this email just a couple of days ago, and it's with her permission and blessing to <unk>
"Hello, <unk> I guess you're at the TED conference.
It must be a whole experience to be there.
I'm thinking that I should go to the bridge this weekend.
I just wanted to leave you a note.
I hope you can tell a lot of people and go home talking about it to your friends telling their friends, and so on.
I'm still quite a lot of <unk> but seeing more moments of realizing that Mike won't really go home.
Mike was driving <unk> to San Francisco to see the <unk> party with her father on the 19th of January.
He never got there.
I called the police of <unk> and <unk> it as disappeared that night.
The next morning, two officials came to my house, and they reported that the car at Mike was down on the bridge.
A witness had seen it jump from the bridge to the <unk> of the day before.
Thank you very much for fighting for those who can be temporarily too weak to fight for themselves.
Who has not been before not having a real mental illness.
It shouldn't be so easy to end it.
My prayers are with you for your struggle.
The <unk> <unk> Bridge is supposed to be a passage through our beautiful bay, not a <unk>
Good luck this week, <unk>
I can't imagine the value that she needed to go to the bridge and walk the way his son took that day, and also the value to go on.
I'd like to introduce you to a man that I mean with hope and value.
On March 11th of 2005, I replied to a radio call by a possible subject to suicide on the sidewalk near the northern tower.
I got my breath on the sidewalk and looked at this man, Kevin <unk> standing on the sidewalk.
When I saw me, she immediately crossed the <unk> and stopped in that little tube that goes around the tower.
Over the hour and a half after, I heard like Kevin spoke about his depression and despair.
Kevin decided to take that day back back to that lane and give it to the other opportunity.
When Kevin came up with it.
"This is a new beginning, a new life."
But I said, "What was it that he did that he did and you gave the hope and life else <unk>
And you know what he told me?
He said, "I <unk>
They stopped me and just <unk>
Shortly after that incident, I got a letter from the Kevin <unk> and I have that letter with me, and I would like to <unk>
"Dear Mr. <unk> Nothing erase the events from 11 March, and you're one of the reasons why Kevin is still with us.
Honestly, I believe that Kevin was paying for help.
It's been diagnosed with a mental illness for which it's been properly <unk>
I went to Kevin when I only had six months, completely unconscious of all those traits -- but thank God, we now know.
Kevin is in order, like the says.
We give God for you.
I really do in debt with you, <unk> <unk>
And in the end, she wrote <unk> When I visited General General Francisco at night, you would go like the patient.
<unk> I did have it to <unk>
Today, Kevin is a <unk> father and a society member of society.
Talk openly about the events of that day and their depression with hope that their story inspire others.
suicide isn't just something that I have found at work.
It's personal.
My grandfather got <unk> with poison.
That act, despite finishing his own pain, theft, chance to meet him.
This is what suicide.
For most people who are <unk> or those who consider the death wouldn't think of hurt someone else.
They just want their own pain.
The general thing is achieved by three things: sleeping drugs or alcohol or death.
In my career, I've responded and I've been involved in hundreds of mental illness and calls from suicide around the bridge.
Of those incidents that I've been directly involved -- I've only lost two, but those two are too much.
One was <unk>
The other one was a man who told him about about an hour.
And during that time, I was looking at the hand at three times.
At the end, I looked at me, and he said, <unk> I'm sorry, but I have to go."
And <unk>
<unk> absolutely nasty.
I want to tell you, though, that the vast majority of the people that we get to contact on that bridge is not <unk>
Also, those few things that have jumped from the bridge and lived and they can talk about it, that one percent or two, most of those people have said to the second that they leave from side the railing realized they had made a mistake and they wanted to live.
I tell people, the bridge doesn't only connect <unk> with San Francisco, but also people.
That connection, or the bridge that we do, is something that everyone and every one of us should be able to do to do.
suicide can prevent.
There's a help. There is hope.
Thank you very much.
The world makes you be what you're not, but in your inside, you know what you are, and a question will tell you, how do you get in that?
I have to be something unique in that sense, but I'm not alone, in any way I'm alone.
When I became a model I felt that eventually had the dream that had had since a child.
My outside finally was going to go through my inner way, with my inner inside.
For complicated reasons, what I'm going to refer to later, when I look at this picture, I think, <unk> <unk> <unk>
But last October, I discovered that, <unk> I'm just beginning.
We all love our families, our religion, our society, our society, our society in history, even our bodies.
Some of you have the value of <unk> to get rid of the limitations of the skin form or by the beliefs of the skin around us.
They are people who are always challenging the status quo, which is considered <unk>
In my case, the last nine years -- a lot of my neighbors, many of my friends, my agent even, ignored my story.
I think this mystery is called <unk>
This is mine.
I was recorded as <unk> at birth because of my genital appearance.
I remember my five years in the Philippines, in my house, I always carried this t-shirt on the head.
And my mom wondered, "Why are you always wearing that t-shirt in the <unk>
I said, "Mom, it's my hair. I'm a <unk>
I knew then how to <unk>
The gender always has been considered a <unk> but now we know that, really, it's a little bit more complex and mystery thing.
Because of my success, I never loved to share my story, not because I thought to be a bad thing, but why the world is about those of us who want to be <unk>
Every day I appreciate being a woman.
I have mom, dad and a family who embrace me.
Many are not so lucky.
There's a long tradition in the <unk> culture that celebrates the mystery of gender.
There's a Buddhist goddess of compassion.
There's a <unk> goddess of <unk>
And when I was eight years old, I was at a party in the Philippines that celebrated these puzzles.
I was in front of the stage and I remember this beautiful woman appeared in front of me, and I remember that moment as if something happened to me. This is the kind of woman I would like to be.
And when I was 15 years old, when I was still wearing man, I met this woman called <unk>
It's the CEO of a contest of beauty <unk>
That night she asked me, "Why haven't you been involved in the <unk> competition.
He told me that if I was <unk> she was <unk> from the <unk> and the wardrobe <unk> and that night, I won in my bathing suit I won in <unk> and she got a third <unk> in the last 40 century.
That moment changed my life.
Suddenly, I was inside the world of beauty.
Not a lot of people can say that their first work was the Queen of beauty of women, but I can.
I also met the <unk> goddess especially when they went to the remote provinces of <unk>
But more importantly, I met my best friends in that community.
In 2001, my mother had moved to San Francisco, he called me and told me that it passed my request from the green card that I could go to the U.S.
I was <unk>
I told my mother, "Mommy, I'm <unk>
I'm here with friends, I like to travel and be a <unk>
But then, two weeks later, I called it and said, "You know that if you get to the United States, you can change the name and the identity of <unk>
It was all I needed to hear.
My mom suggested to me to put two <unk> to my name.
She also accompanied me when I was <unk> in Thailand to the 19 years.
It's curious that in some of the most rural cities in Thailand do the most sophisticated surgeries and safe surgeries are safe.
And then in the U.S., it was necessary to do surgery before they changed the name and gender.
So in 2001, I went to San Francisco, and I remember looking at the driver's license with the name <unk> and the gender <unk> <unk>
It was a great time.
For some people, your document of identity means to be able to drive or be able to get a <unk> but for me it was my license to live, to feel <unk>
Suddenly, my fears was <unk>
I felt that I could conquer my dream and move to New York, and it will be model.
Many are not so lucky.
I think of this woman of <unk> <unk> <unk>
A young woman in New York who <unk> he lived his truth, but he said, <unk> put his life.
For many of my community, that's the reality that they live.
Our suicide rates are eight times higher than the rest of the population.
All 20 of November we do a global vigil by <unk> Day.
I'm on this stage, because of a long history of people who are <unk> and stood in front of injustice.
These are Marsha P. Johnson and Sylvia <unk>
Today, right now, I'm coming out of the closet.
I can't keep my reality in living and just for me.
I want to do the best to help others live their truth without shame, or fear.
I'm here, <unk> for some day no longer than 20 percent <unk>
My deepest truth led me to accept what I am.
Do you you?
Thank you very much.
Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you --  <unk> <unk> a quick question.
<unk> <unk> Yeah. <unk> first, thank all of my <unk>
My parents, my parents especially, to my family, which is very strong.
I remember all the times that I've been to young women <unk> who have been <unk> and sometimes when they were called me and told me that his parents couldn't accept it, I called my mom and called my mom and said, "Mommy, can you call this <unk>
Sometimes it worked -- it's not. It's just identity identity, that's what is in the center of what we are, right?
I mean, all of us were assigned a gender at birth, and what I try to do is to put on the table that sometimes that assignment, not block, and there should be a space that would allow people to <unk> and this is a conversation that we should have with parents, with colleagues.
The <unk> movement is <unk> compared to the gay movement.
There's still a lot of work to do.
There should be understanding.
There should be space for curiosity and to ask questions, and I hope all of you are my allies.
KS: Thank you. Very nice <unk> Thank you.
In many <unk> societies and tribal societies, the parents are usually known for their children, but I'm one of the few parents who meet her daughter and I'm proud of it.
<unk> started his campaign for education by defending their rights in the 2007. And when he <unk> his efforts in 2011, by <unk> the National <unk> <unk> became very famous -- a very popular girl in his country.
Before that, I was my daughter, but now I'm her father.
Ladies and gentlemen, if you look at the human history, the story of women is the story of the <unk> of inequality, of violence and exploitation.
You see, in <unk> societies right from the beginning, when we were born, a child, his birth is not <unk>
He's not welcome or for his father, nor for his mother.
The neighborhood comes, gives her <unk> to the mother and no one <unk> the father.
And a mother was <unk> a lot for a little girl.
When you give birth to the first girl, the first daughter, the first daughter, is sad.
When he gives birth to the second daughter, he was <unk> and with the hope of a son, when he took her third daughter, you feel guilty like a criminal.
Not only a mother suffering, but the daughter was just <unk> when it grows, it suffers as well.
At the age of five years, when I should go to school, you stay home and the school admits of her siblings.
Up to the age of 12 years, in a way, it has a good life.
Can you imagine?
He can play with your friends on the street, and it can move through the streets as a butterfly.
But when you go into adolescence, when it comes to 13 years, you will have to prohibit her home without a male <unk>
It's confined to the four walls of their house.
It's no longer a free person.
It becomes the honor called her father and her brothers and his family, and if you were to <unk> the code of that <unk> honor, could even kill.
And it's interesting that this one of the code of honor, doesn't only affect the life of a <unk> also affects the lives of male members of the family.
So this brother, <unk> the joys of his life and happiness of their sisters on behalf of honor.
And there's a norm more than <unk> societies called <unk>
A good girl has to be very <unk> very <unk> and very <unk>
It's the <unk>
The model of a good girl must be <unk>
It's supposed to be <unk> and embracing people's decisions and their mother and the decisions of the elderly, even if you don't want it.
If you put it with a man who doesn't like it, or if the <unk> with an old man has to be <unk> because it doesn't want to be <unk>
If the <unk> very young, it has to accept it.
Otherwise, the <unk> <unk>
And what happens to the end?
In words of a <unk> "The <unk> <unk> and then gives birth to more children and <unk>
And the irony of the situation is that this mother, <unk> the same lesson to <unk> her daughter and the same lesson to honor their children.
And this vicious cycle continues and continues.
<unk> brothers and sisters, when I was born <unk> and for the first time, believe me, I don't like the newborns, to be honest, but when I was there and looked at his eyes, believe me, I felt extremely <unk>
And so much before I came back, I thought about her name, and I was fascinated with a <unk> <unk> of freedom in Afghanistan.
His name was <unk> <unk> and he called my daughter like that.
But when I was born, they were all men, and grabbed my pen, <unk> a line of my name, and I wrote, <unk>
And when she was going, when she was four and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half and a half years on my school.
You might be wondering, why should I mention a little girl in a school?
Yes, I should <unk>
You can take it for granted in Canada, in the United States, in many developed countries, but in the poor countries, in the tribal societies, in tribal societies, is a great event for a child.
<unk> in a school means recognition of his identity and his name.
One <unk> to school means that it has entered the world of dreams and the aspirations where it can explore their potential for their future life.
I have five sisters, and none of them could go to school, and they would be <unk> two weeks earlier, when I went through the form of Professor Canada, and he was in the relative part of the family, I couldn't remember the <unk> of some of my sisters.
And the reason I was never seen the names of my sisters written in any document.
That was why value to my daughter.
Which my father couldn't give my sisters and his daughters, I thought I had to change it.
I used to appreciate the intelligence and the <unk> of my daughter.
He was going to sit with me when my friends came to see me.
The encouraged to go with me to different meetings.
And all of these values, I've tried to do it on their personality.
And this was not just for her, just for <unk>
I have <unk> all these good values in my school to girls and kids alike.
I used education for <unk>
I took my daughters, taught the students to forget the lesson of <unk>
I taught students to forget the lesson of the so-called <unk>
<unk> brothers and sisters, and they fought for more rights for women, and they were <unk> to have more and more space for women in society.
But we find a new phenomenon.
It was lethal for human rights and in particular, for women's rights.
It was called <unk>
That means a complete denial of women's participation in all of the political, economic and social activities.
Hundreds of schools were lost.
The girls were banned to school.
Women were forced to use <unk> and they stopped going to the markets.
The musicians were <unk> the <unk> girls and the singers were killed.
<unk> millions, but a few <unk> and it was scary to have around those people who kill and <unk> when you talk about their rights.
It's really terrifying.
At the age of 10 years, I got up and got up on the right to education.
He wrote a newspaper for the BBC, blog to the BBC, <unk> she offered her himself for the New York Times, and I spoke on every platform that he could.
And his voice was the most powerful voice.
It was <unk> as a <unk> around the world.
And that was the reason that the Taliban couldn't tolerate his campaign and the ninth of October 2012, I was shot on the head.
It was a day <unk> for my family and me.
The world became a great black hole.
Whereas my daughter was <unk> between life and death, he would give me the ear to my wife -- <unk> <unk> so I spent my daughter to your <unk>
And <unk> said, "Please, don't you <unk>
We have a fair cause.
<unk> your life in play by the cause of peace, because of the cause of peace, and the cause of education, and your daughter was inspired by you and they were <unk>
They were both on the right path, and God <unk>
These few words are going to be a lot for me, and I didn't go back to ask again.
When I was in the hospital and I had severe pain, and he had severe headaches because his facial nerve was <unk> I used to see a dark shadow that was held by my wife's face.
But my daughter never <unk>
I used to say, "I'm okay with my smile <unk> and with my face.
I'm going to give you good. Please do not <unk>
It was a comfort for us, and we were <unk>
<unk> brothers and sisters, we've learned from her to resist at the most difficult moments, and I'm pleased to share with you that despite being an icon for the rights and women and women, it's like any <unk>
<unk> when he doesn't end his task.
They fight their siblings, and I'm very happy for that.
People ask me, "What are there special in my <unk> who has made so bold and so courageous and expressive and <unk>
I mean, don't ask me what I did.
<unk> what I didn't do.
I didn't cut their wings and that's it.
Thank you very much.
Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you.
I was <unk> from the brain 18 years ago, and from that day, the science of the brain has become a personal passion.
I'm engineering.
And I want to tell you that I recently joined the <unk> group of Google, where I've had a <unk> to my <unk> the <unk> of Google X-ray. But all the work I'm talking about today about the science of the brain, I did it before I joined Google or out of my work there.
Having said this, there is a stigma when you hit a brain operation,
You're still the same as smart or not?
It's not going to be like that, you will be <unk>
After the <unk> I was missing a part of the brain, and I had to live with it.
It wasn't the biological matter, but it was the dead part of the center that creates important hormones and <unk>
And immediately after the operation, I had to decide what a number of <unk> of more than a dozen chemicals every day, because if I didn't take anything, would die in a few hours.
Every day, over the last 18 years, I've had to decide about the combinations and mix of chemicals, and try to deal with them to keep alive.
More than once I've been saved by a little bit.
But luckily, I have a soul of <unk> so I decided to be able to get the dose, to try to get the dose, because it really doesn't have a clear map to say it in <unk>
I started testing some different <unk> and I was shocked by seeing how small changes in the minor dose, drastically <unk> my sense of who I am, my way to think, my behavior with others.
A particularly <unk> case for a few months, I tried dose and chemical chemicals for a graduate man, and I was surprised to see how to <unk> my thoughts.
I was always <unk> I thought all the time on sex, and I thought it was the most intelligent person around the world, and --  of course, many times in the past I've met several kinds of stuff, or maybe some versions of the <unk>
It turned out as a extreme.
But my great surprise was that I wasn't trying to be <unk>
In fact, there was a little bit of <unk> to fix a problem I had in front of it, and it just didn't happen like that.
So I couldn't handle it.
It changed my <unk>
But I think that experience gave me a new appreciation of men and about what they have to do -- I've been better with men.
What I was trying to do, as we adjust those hormones and neurotransmitters and so on, it was reclaim my intelligence after the disease and <unk> my creative thinking -- my flow of ideas.
<unk> thinking about all of the images, and that became my point of reference point -- how do those mental images that I use to create <unk> my ideas, if you were <unk> new ideas and <unk>
This kind of thoughts is not new.
<unk> like <unk> Descartes and <unk> see things in the same way.
They thought that images and ideas were the same thing.
Today there are people who challenge this idea, and there are a lot of discussions about how your mind works for me, is simple: for most of us, the mental images are fundamental to <unk> thinking and <unk>
So after several years, I got to find the point right now, and I have a lot of great <unk> mental <unk> really, really good enough and good <unk>
Now, I'm working on how to take these mental images out of my mind to the computer screen.
Can you imagine what would happen if a director of cinema was able to use their imagination only to lead to the world that has the <unk>
Or if a musician could extract the music from your head?
There are incredible possibilities with this, as the way people can get to share the speed of light.
And the truth is, the only difficulty to do this is simply to increase the resolution of our brain scanning systems.
Let me show you why I think we're pretty close to this with two recent experiments made by two major experiments in neuroscience.
They both used MRI technology, image by functional magnetic resonance to represent the brain here, you can see brain scan done by <unk> <unk> and his colleagues at Harvard.
The column on the left shows the brain scan of a person looking at an image.
The <unk> column shows the scan of the brain of that same individual as you get to see that same image.
The column on the right was created <unk> the contents of the central column on the left of the left of the left.
This is <unk> in many different individuals with many different images, always with a similar outcome.
The difference between seeing an image and imagine seeing that particular image.
Now, let me share with you another experiment. This is from the Australian lab lab in Berkeley, California.
They managed to convert brain waves into visual visual fields.
Let's put this in this way.
In this experiment, I showed people hundreds of hours of YouTube videos as they <unk> their brains to create a large pool of brain reactions to video sequences.
And then I showed you a movie with new images, new animals, and as long as it was <unk> a new <unk>
The computer using just the brain information from scanning <unk> to show what it seemed like the person was seeing.
On the right side, you can see the computer <unk> and on the left, the video that I showed you.
This left us <unk>
We're pretty close to doing this.
We just need to improve resolution.
And now, remember, when you look at an image and when you imagine that same image, it creates the same picture, the same <unk>
This was done with the <unk> brain scanning systems available today, and their resolution is a thousand times in the last few years.
Now we need to increase the resolution a thousand times more to get a deeper look.
How did we get there?
There are many techniques to do it.
One is opening the skull and put electrodes.
I don't offer that one.
A lot of people are proposing new techniques of projection for images, including me, <unk> with the recent outcome of the MRI -- first we need to ask the following, this technology will be the end of the <unk>
The conventional wisdom says that the only way to get bigger resolution is with larger, but at this point, more <unk> magnets only offer small improvements on the resolution, not increases by thousands of as we need.
I propose this idea: instead of <unk> <unk> make better magnets.
We can create much more complex structures with slightly different structures, like making a <unk>
And why does this matter?
In the last few years, a huge amount of effort in MRI were to do <unk> <unk> right?
And yet, most of the recent breakthroughs in <unk> of clever and brilliant solutions are <unk> and <unk> in the urine, and often radio radio rates in MRI systems.
Instead, instead of a magnetic field with the magnetic field, we would see <unk> magnetic patterns <unk> to the radio frequencies.
So by combining magnetic patterns with the patterns of processing radio patterns, we can actually increase the information that you can extract in a single <unk>
In addition, we can then divide into layers of our growing knowledge of the brain structure and memory to create the increase in the thousands we need.
By using the <unk> we should be able to measure not only the blood fluid -- but the <unk> hormones and <unk> that I mentioned and perhaps even physical neural activity is sleep.
We are able to put our ideas into direct form to digital media.
Can you imagine if we could move above language and communicate directly by <unk>
What would we be <unk>
And how do we learn to deal with the truths of human thinking without <unk>
You thought the Internet is a big thing.
These are great questions.
It would be customized to use as a tool to amplify our thinking and communication.
Certainly, this same tool could lead to Alzheimer's disease and similar diseases.
We have a few options more options than open this door.
Anyway, choose one year, will happen in five or 15 years?
It's hard to imagine that it will take much more.
We have to learn how to take this step together.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk to you tonight about leaving the closet, and not in a traditional sense, not just the gay closet.
I think we all have <unk>
His closet maybe to tell some person for the first time your love or say to someone who is pregnant, or say to someone who has cancer, or any other difficult conversation for which you have to do in life.
All shapes is a difficult conversation, and even though our issues can vary <unk> the experience of having lived and to come out of that closet is universal.
Day fear, and we don't like to happen.
A lot of years ago, I was working in the South Side <unk> <unk> a restaurant in the city, and being out there, I had to go through several stages of the intensity of <unk> <unk> not <unk> my armpits, quote the letters of <unk> I gave <unk> as a <unk>
And I'm going to be slope by the <unk> of my short <unk> and I would have <unk> my head on a little bit, I would ask the head of a child, and I would say, "Hey, you're a kid or a <unk>
And there'd be a uncomfortable silence on the table.
I took my jaw a little bit more, I would take my coffee with a <unk>
The father said, <unk> the newspaper and the mother launched a cold, look at his son.
But I would not say anything, and I would go through it.
And I came to the point that every time I was going to a place where there was a child between three and 10 years, I was ready to fight.
And that's a terrible feeling.
So I promised you that the next time I would say something.
I would have that hard conversation.
So after a few weeks, it happened again.
"You're a guy or a <unk>
A familiar silence, but this time I was prepared and I was about to get into the female issues at the table.  I had the quotes from Betty <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>
Even a fragment of the "Vagina Monologues," <unk>
And so I took a deep shot and I went down my back and my back, a <unk> girl with a pink dress, looking at what it's not a challenge for a feminist, a feminist, a girl with a question: "You're a boy or <unk>
And then I took a long shot again, and I got <unk> near her, and I said, "Hey, I know this is <unk>
I have the short hair like a kid, and I have seen clothes, but I am a girl, and you know, as you like to use a pink dress.
All right, I'm more than a girl from a silver <unk>
And that girl looked at me <unk> and he said, "My favorite jewelry is <unk> and he's got a fish.
You can give you a <unk>
And that's it. I just said, "Oh, good. You're a girl.
What about the <unk> that <unk>
It was the most easy conversation that I ever had.
And by <unk> because the girl of the <unk> and I, both of us were <unk> the one with the other.
So as many of us, I have lived in some microbloggers in my life, and yes, my walls used to be a <unk>
But in the dark, you can't know what color the walls.
You just know how one feels like living in a closet.
That's how my closet is not different from you or yours or yours.
<unk> I'll give you a hundred reasons why I get out of my closet was more difficult to get out of his, but this is the <unk> It's hard to be <unk>
The hard thing is hard.
Who can tell me that to explain to someone who has <unk> <unk> is harder than saying that it's been <unk>
Who can tell me that this story I tell you that this story is more difficult than telling your son of five years that you're going to be <unk>
There's no hardest thing, there is just the hard thing.
We need to stop creating what is hard about what is difficult for other people to make us feel better or worse than our muse and we need to just feel empathy because we all live something hard.
At some point in our lives, we all live in <unk> and they can make security, or at least security than the other side of the door.
But I'm here to tell you that no matter what their walls are made of, a closet is not a place to live.
Thank you.  Imagine yourself 20 years ago.
I, who had a horse line in a horse, a dress.
It wasn't the militant lesbian prepared to fight any four years to go into the coffee.
I was frozen by the fear of fear, <unk> in a corner of my dark closet <unk> and the <unk> just a muscle is the most scary thing ever done.
My family, my whole friends with whom I've spent my entire life trying to not <unk> and now the world would turn around purpose.
He was burning the pages of a script that we've all followed by so long, but if you don't toss that <unk> you kill.
One of my most memorable grenade was on my sister.
It was the first time that many of them were invited to know that I was gay, and when I did my <unk> <unk> <unk> in my black dress and <unk> walked around the tables and finally came to one where my friends of my parents, people who knew me for years.
And after speaking a moment, one of the women cried <unk> Nathan <unk>
And the battle of the gay story had begun.
<unk> once you were in the <unk>
"Well, yeah, the truth is we have friends in San <unk>
"Well, we've never gone there, but we've heard it's <unk>
<unk> you know my <unk> <unk>
It's very good and never talked about having <unk>
<unk> what is your TV TV show.
Our <unk> program <unk> and Grace <unk>
And you know who we are <unk> <unk>
Jack is our <unk>
And then a woman, <unk> but instead of showing you desperately their support, to get me to know that I was on my side, he finally said, "Well, sometimes my husband uses <unk> shirts for me.
And I had an opportunity at that time, as you have all the Scud <unk>
<unk> could have been easy to indicate where they felt <unk>
It's not very difficult to find them and realize that they were <unk>
And what else can you ask someone, but <unk>
If you will be authentic with somebody, you have to be prepared for the authentic thing to do.
This is how hard conversations continue not to be my strong point.
Ask anybody that I have <unk>
But I'm getting better, and I follow what I like to call the first three of the Girl <unk>
Now, please look at this through the gay perspective, but understand that what it involves coming out of any closet is essentially the same.
Number one: Be authentic.
<unk> <unk> Be yourself.
That little girl in the coffee didn't have <unk> but I was ready for the battle.
If you want someone to be <unk> the others should know we do suffer.
Number two: Be <unk> simply <unk> <unk> your <unk>
If you know that they are gay, <unk>
If you say to their parents that maybe they might be gay, they will keep the hope that that could change.
They don't give you a sense of false hope.
And number three, and more important --  Let the complex.
You communicate your truth.
It will never be bothered by that.
And some of them can be injured safe, <unk> so they have done, but it never Sorry.
And yes, maybe some of you feel <unk> but that's something in them.
Those are the expectations of them about what you are, but not his.
That's the story of them, but not from you.
The only story that matters is what you want to write.
So the next time you find in a dark direction, <unk> a <unk> must know that we've all been there before.
And you might feel very alone, but they don't.
Thank you, <unk> Enjoy the <unk>
<unk> what is that?
If you look at the story of how the intelligence has been seen -- an example of productive example has been the famous quote by <unk> <unk> that "The question of whether a machine can think is as interesting as the question of whether a submarine can be <unk>
When he <unk> <unk> wrote this as a criticism of computing pioneers as Alan <unk>
And so, a few years ago, we would have a program to try to understand the fundamental fundamental physical mechanisms of intelligence.
Let's go back a step.
First, let's start with a mental experiment.
Imagine that they're from an empty race that you don't know anything about the biology of the Earth nor from the Earth's Earth or of the Earth, but they have incredible telescopes and you can see the Earth, and they have incredibly long lives, so you can see the Earth for millions, even billions of years.
And you see a very strange effect.
Of course, as <unk> we know that the reason it would be that we're trying to save ourselves.
We're trying to avoid an impact.
But if you are from a alien race that doesn't know anything about this, that it has no concept of the Earth's intelligence of the Earth, you'd have to be forced to develop a physical theory that would explain how, to some point in time, the asteroids that <unk> the surface of a <unk> planet.
And so I claim that this is the same question that the understanding of the physical nature of intelligence.
So in this program that I conducted several years ago, I studied a variety of issues through science, through various disciplines, that <unk> I think, to a single underlying mechanism of intelligence.
In <unk> for example, there has been a variety of evidence that our universe seems to be <unk> adjusted to the development of intelligence, and in particular, for the development of universal states that we prescribe the diversity of possible future.
Finally, in planning of robotic movement, there's been a variety of recent techniques that have tried to harness the skills of robots to maximize future freedom of action in order to perform complex tasks.
And so, by taking all of these different issues and <unk> together, I said, as a number of years years ago, there is an underlying mechanism for the intelligence that we can extract from all these different <unk>
Is there only one equation for intelligence.
And I think the answer is yes. What you're seeing is probably the closest equivalent to a E = <unk> for the intelligence that I have ever seen.
So what you're seeing here is an assertion that intelligence is a force that intelligence is a force, F, that acts in order to maximize future freedom of action.
It acts to maximize the future freedom of action, or keeping the open choices with a force -- with the diversity of possible future accessible, Yes, to an impending future time.
In a nutshell, intelligence doesn't like to get <unk>
intelligence is trying to maximize future freedom of action and to keep the options open.
And so having to account this equation, it's natural to ask: What can you do with this?
How <unk> is it?
<unk> the level of human <unk>
<unk> intelligence <unk>
So I'm going to show you now a video I think, showing some of the amazing applications of this simple equation.
Narrator: <unk> research in cosmology have suggested that universes that produce more mess, or <unk> during their life should have more favorable conditions for the existence of intelligent beings like us.
But what if that <unk> connection is between entropy and intelligence -- a more <unk> relationship.
What if intelligent behavior is not only correlated with the production of entropy in the long term, but actually comes directly from her?
To find out, we've developed a software engine called <unk> designed to maximize the production of entropy of long-term entropy in any system in which you can find inside.
Amazingly, <unk> could be able to spend multiple animal testing, play games, and even making money <unk> actions, all of that without being able to do that.
Here are some examples of <unk> in action.
Like a <unk> human <unk> here we see <unk> <unk> automatically a pole using a <unk>
This behavior is remarkable partly because we never gave them a goal.
He just decided to figure out how to balance the <unk>
This ability of equilibrium will have applications for humanoid robotics and human assistance technologies.
This ability of using tools will have applications in intelligent manufacturing and agriculture.
Also, just like some other animals can cooperate pulling aside from the opposite opposite of a rope at the same time to release the food, here we see that <unk> can perform a version of that task.
This ability of cooperation has interesting consequences for economic planning and in a variety of other fields.
<unk> is widely applied to a variety of <unk>
For example, here we do successfully see a game of <unk> against itself, <unk> their potential for play.
Here we see <unk> <unk> new connections to a social network where friends are constantly <unk> and keeps the network well connected.
This same capacity of network <unk> also has applications in health care, and on energy and intelligence.
Here we see <unk> organizing the routes of a boats, discovering them successfully and using the Panama Canal, to expand the world from the Atlantic to the Pacific.
In the same way, <unk> is widely applicable to problems and logistics and transportation.
Finally, here we see <unk> spontaneously discovering and running a strategy of <unk> <unk> in a simulated series of negotiation to actions, successfully increasing assets under their management exponentially.
This is the risk of risk management will have vast applications in finance and safe.
Alex <unk> What you've seen is that a variety of marks of cognitive human human behaviors such as the use of tools, walking upright and social cooperation -- all of us from one equation, which leads to a system to maximize their future freedom of action.
Now, here's a profound <unk>
Let's go back to the beginning of the term use robot, and there was always the concept that if you were <unk> intelligent machines, there would be a rebellion <unk>
The machines are linked to us.
One of the biggest consequences of this work is that maybe all of these decades, we have had all the concept of rebellion <unk> in reverse.
It's not that the machines first become smart, and then <unk> and trying to take over the world.
It's all the opposite, that the urge to take control of all the future possible is a more fundamental principle than the intelligence that general intelligence can actually come out of control -- instead of being upside down.
Another important consequence is the pursuit of the target.
And often they ask me, how do you look for goals to learn from this kind of <unk>
My equivalent to that statement to move to the descendants of helping them build artificial artificial artificial intelligence or to help them understand human intelligence, is this: intelligence must be seen as a physical process that tries to maximize future freedom of action and avoid restrictions on their own future.
Thank you very much.
We're at a tipping point in human history, which is something between the <unk> of stars and losing the planet that we call <unk>
Although, in the last few years, we've extended our knowledge of how the Earth fits in the context of the universe.
The Kepler mission of NASA has discovered thousands of possible planets orbiting other stars, what points to Earth is only one between billions of planets in our galaxy.
Kepler is a space telescope that measures light light intensity from stars when the planets go ahead of them, and they block a little bit of that light that will go.
The data gathered by Kepler show the sizes of planets in addition to the distance that there is between them and their mother.
So together, this helps us understand whether these planets are small and <unk> like the ground planets of our solar system, and also the amount of light they get from their <unk>
At its time, this gives up clues about whether these planets that we find are habitable or not.
Unfortunately, as we find this treasure treasure of protected worlds, our own planet is <unk> under the weight of humanity.
The 2014 year was the hottest <unk>
<unk> and ice ice that have been with us for a millennia, they're now disappearing in a matter of decades.
These environmental changes that we've caused on a global scale have moved rapidly to our ability to alter their course.
But I'm not a science scientist in the weather, no <unk>
But I study the <unk> of the planet influenced by the stars, to find places in the universe where to find life beyond our planet.
You might say I'm looking for alien opportunities in the property sector.
Now, as someone who is very interested in the search for life in the universe I can tell you that the more planets look like the Earth -- most of our own planet.
Each of these new worlds invites a comparison between the newly discovered planet, and the planets that we know better.
Let's take our neighbor, Mars.
Mars is small and <unk> and despite being a little further away from the Sun, it can be a potentially livable world that shows this by a mission like <unk>
In fact, it's possible that Mars has been <unk> in the past and part of it that we study so much to Mars.
Our <unk> like <unk> tracks its surface to search of clues about the origins of life as we know it.
The satellites that <unk> like the <unk> mission -- they take samples from the atmosphere and try to understand how Mars has been able to lose their <unk>
Companies now offer not only short space flights but also the possibility of living on Mars.
But even though all of these images are <unk> remind us to the deserts of our planet, places that are linked in our imagination with the <unk> ideas and <unk> compared to the Earth, Mars is a pretty terrible place to live.
Let's take the extension of the <unk> areas of our planet that still stay by <unk> places in comparison to Mars.
Even in the most <unk> and higher places on Earth is fresh and full of oxygen <unk> by our tropical forests to thousands of miles away.
I worry that this excitement about the colonization of Mars and other planets <unk> with a big and sad thing, the implication and the belief that Mars is waiting for us to save this <unk> <unk> of the only planet that we know is truly livable on Earth.
For a lot of me like <unk> exploration, I'm in deep disagreement with this idea.
There are a lot of good reasons to go to Mars, but saying that Mars is going to be there to be there to join humanity is how to imagine that the captain of the Titanic will tell us that the captain of the Titanic will be later on the <unk> <unk>   Thank you.
But the targets for <unk> exploration and land preservation is not <unk>
No, they're actually faces of the same <unk> the goal of understanding and to improve life in the future.
The extreme environments in our world look like <unk> <unk>
They only get closer to home.
If we can understand how to create and maintain <unk> spaces in the hostile and <unk> spaces of land, maybe we can satisfy the need to preserve our environment and go beyond that.
I leave you with a <unk> <unk> paradox.
A lot of years ago, the physicist, Enrico Fermi asked me, on account that our universe has been around for a long time, and we hope that there were many planets in this universe, we should have found the evidence of life in alien life so far.
Well, where are they?
Well, one possible solution to the paradox of Fermi is that when civilizations become advanced advanced enough to consider living between the stars, lose the notion of the important thing that we can protect the origin of the planets that are going to develop this development.
That is arrogant to think that only marine colonization, will save us ourselves, but the planetary preservation and <unk> exploration can work together.
If we really believe in our ability to engage the hostile environments of Mars to the human presence -- then we should be able to overcome the task even easier to preserve the <unk> on Earth.
Thank you.
A few years ago, I went home.
And as I was on the front porch looking in my pockets, I realized that I didn't have the keys.
In fact, I could see the window that they were on the dining table where there were <unk>
So fast I tried to open all the other doors and windows, and they were all well closed.
I thought about calling a <unk> at least I had my cell phone, but at midnight, a <unk> could take a long time to get there, and it was cold.
I couldn't go back home from my friend of Jeff to go through the night because I had an early flight to Europe in the morning, and I took off my passport and my <unk>
<unk> expensive, but sure no more expensive than a <unk> to average night, so I thought, despite the circumstances, it was well stopped.
I am a profession and I know a little bit about how your brain works under stress.
<unk> <unk> that increases heart rate -- <unk> the level of adrenaline and <unk>
And when I got to the <unk> of <unk> at the airport, I realized that I didn't have my passport.
Well, I had a lot of time to think about those eight hours without sleep.
And I started wondering, if there was something I could do, systems that could put in his place, which would be bad things to happen.
Or at least, if you go wrong with bad things, you know, the probability of it is a total catastrophe of it.
So I started thinking about that, but until a month after my thoughts were not <unk>
I was having dinner with my colleague Danny <unk> who's the Nobel Prize, and a little embarrassed I told him that I broke the window, and that I had forgotten my <unk> and Danny shared with me who had been practicing something called retrospective retrospective
It's something that he had learned from the psychologist Gary <unk> who had written this was a few years before, known as the <unk>
You all know what the <unk> is.
Every time there's a disaster, a team of experts come and tries to figure out what went wrong, right?
In <unk> as you explain <unk> you look forward and try to figure out all of the things that might go wrong, and then try to figure out what can do to prevent things out or to minimize the damage.
So what I want to talk about with you is some things that we can do in the form of a <unk>
Some of them are <unk> others are not so evident.
I'm going to start with the obvious ones.
In the house, I would give you a place for things that are very easily.
This sounds common and it is, but there's a lot of science that supports this <unk> based on how our space memory.
There is a structure in the brain called hippocampus, which has evolved over thousands of years, to track the location of the important things, where the hell are all right, where the fish are, where the fish are where the <unk> trees live.
The hippocampus is the part of the brain that is <unk> in the London <unk>
It's the part of the brain that allows the <unk> to find their nuts.
And if you ask if someone really did the experiment, they cut the sense of <unk> and they could still find their nuts.
They didn't use the smell, but the hippocampus, that very evolved mechanism of the brain to find things.
But it's really good for things that don't move much, not so good for things that move a lot.
This is the reason for losing keys from the car and reading and <unk>
So at home <unk> a place for keys, a hook along the door, maybe a plate of <unk>
For your <unk> a particular drawer for it.
For your reading, a particular <unk>
If you put a place and are <unk> with it your stuff will always be there when the <unk>
What about the <unk>
Take a picture of your credit card cards, a license card license, <unk> <unk> for themselves to be in the cloud.
If these things are lost or <unk> this can be <unk>
These are some of the most obvious things.
Remember, when it's under stress, your brain releases cortisol.
<unk> is toxic and <unk>
So part of <unk> practice is to recognize that under stress we're not at the best moment, and you have to put the systems on their site.
And there is perhaps no more stressful situation that when you face a medical decision.
And at some point, we're all in that situation, to have to make a very important decision about the future of our medical care or about a loved being, to help them with a decision.
And so I want to talk about that.
And I'll talk about a very particular medical condition.
But this is <unk> as a <unk> for all of the decision-making of medical decisions, and in fact for the decision-making of financial decisions and social decisions, any kind of decision that we have to take away from that would benefit from the facts.
So suppose you go to the doctor and the doctor says, "I have received the result of the lab and cholesterol is a little bit <unk>
You all know that high cholesterol is associated with a higher risk of heart disease, attack, brain injury.
So you're thinking that having high cholesterol is not the best, then the doctor says, "I'd like to <unk> a drug that will help reduce the <unk> a <unk>
And maybe you've heard about the <unk> and you know that it's one of the most <unk> drugs in the world today, even you are likely to know people who are <unk>
So you say, "Yes, <unk> <unk>
But there's a question that should be done then, a statistic that you should ask for that most doctors don't want to speak, and the pharmaceutical companies even less.
It's for the <unk> the number necessary to treat.
And what is this, the <unk>
It's the number of people who have to take a drug or to have surgery at any medical procedure before you can help one person.
And it should think of what kind of statistical statistic is <unk>
The number must be one.
My doctor didn't give me something if I wasn't to help me.
But actually, medical practice doesn't work like this.
And it's not the doctor, and if it's someone's guilt -- it's scientists like me.
We haven't understood very well the mechanisms of <unk>
But estimates of <unk> that 90 percent of drugs works just from 30 percent of the people.
So the number that you need to treat the most widely <unk> which you think is it?
How many people have it to take it before you can help someone do it before you can help one person.
300.
This is by the research of the cynical researchers <unk> <unk> and Pamela <unk> <unk> <unk>
I do the numbers.
300 people have to take the drug for a year before to avoid a single heart attack, brain or another <unk> event.
Now you might be thinking, "Well, one chance in 300 of my <unk>
Why no, <unk> <unk> the recipe for all <unk>
But then you have to ask for a more statistic statistic and it is, <unk> from the <unk> Right?
For this particular drug, the side effects are produced in five percent of the patients.
And those include things that include muscle pain and <unk> pain <unk> but they are now thinking, "The five percent is not very likely that it will happen to me, even if you take the <unk>
But a moment.
remember that under stress doesn't think more clearly.
So think about how to take this over time, so they don't have to make the chain of thinking about the act.
300 people take the drug, right? A person has <unk> five percent of the 300 have side effects, that's 15 people.
You have 15 times more likely to get rid of the drug that will help you medicine.
I don't say they should or not take the <unk>
I just say you must have this conversation with your doctor.
The medical ethic does that; it's part of the beginning of informed consent.
We have the right to have access to this kind of information to start the conversation about whether you want to take the risks or not.
And you may be thinking that I've launched this number in the air for the value of the crash, but actually this number that you need to treat is quite typical.
For the surgery that the more is done in the older men of 50, prostate of prostate cancer, the number you need to treat is <unk>
So 49 surgeries for a person who has <unk>
And the side effects in that case, are produced in 50 percent of the patients.
Those include the helplessness or dysfunction -- <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And if you're lucky, and it's one of that 50 percent of the effects just <unk> one year or two.
So the idea of <unk> is to think about before the questions that you can ask you to do that would take the conversation forward.
You don't have to make this all in the act.
And they also want to think about the quality of life.
Because you have a choice a lot of times, they want a more short life of pain, or a longer life that might have a lot of pain in the end?
These are the things they speak and think about now, with their family and their loved ones.
You can change opinion in the heat of the moment, but at least you're trained in this kind of thinking.
Remember, our brain releases <unk> under stress, and one of the things that happens at that time is that they turn out a lot of systems.
There's an evolutionary reason for this.
<unk> face with a predator, you don't need the <unk> system or the <unk> or the immune system, because if the body is spending the metabolism on those things, it doesn't react very quickly. They could be the lunch of the lions, so none of that matters.
Unfortunately, one of the things that goes through the window during those moments of stress is the kind of thinking, rational thinking, like Danny <unk> and his colleagues have shown you.
So we have to think about the future of this kind of situations.
I think what's important here is to recognize that we're all <unk>
We're all going to fail at a time.
The idea is to think about the future how they might be those <unk> to put systems in the place that will help minimize damage, or to prevent the bad things on the first place.
I went back to the night of snow in Montreal, when I went back from my journey, my contractor formed a <unk> of combination along the door, with a key door to the same gate an easy way to remember it.
And I have to admit that I still have lots of cards that I haven't ordered and lots of messages that I haven't read about.
So I'm not very organized, but I see the organization like a <unk> process, and I'm doing it.
Thank you very much.
Interpreter: <unk> <unk> is my favorite music.
It means playing <unk>
If you're playing a musical instrument, and you see a <unk> in the <unk> you need to touch more <unk>
Two <unk> even more smooth.
Four <unk> extremely smooth.
This is my drawing of a <unk> tree there, you see that no matter how many thousands and thousands of <unk> may never be <unk> to a complete silence.
That's my current definition of <unk> a very dark sound.
I'd like to share a little bit about the history of the American American system, the <unk> in addition to a little bit of my own story.
The French signs came over the decade in 1800, and over the time step of time, it mixed with local signs, and developed the language that we now know as <unk>
So it has a story about 200 years.
I was born <unk> and I was taught to believe that sound was not a part of my life.
And I thought it was true.
However, I realize it's not true to nothing.
<unk> are a very important part of my life, really in my mind every day.
As a <unk> person who lives in a world of sounds, is as if I lived in a foreign country, following a foreign country, following their rules, they have <unk> behaviors and norms of <unk>
So how do you understand the sound <unk>
Well, I see how people behave and respond to sound.
People are like my speakers and <unk> the sound.
<unk> and <unk> that behavior.
At the same time, I've learned that I can create sounds, and I've seen how people <unk>
So I learned, for example here.
"Not <unk> <unk>
"Don't do a lot of noise to eat the bag of chips.
"Not <unk> and when you're eating, make sure you didn't get the <unk> on the <unk>
I call this <unk> <unk>
Maybe I think about the sound tag more than the average person does it.
I am <unk> <unk> of sounds.
And I'm always waiting for the sound of the sound, which is for coming next.
There this drawing.
decide.
<unk> to continue.
<unk> for <unk>
You can see the <unk> doesn't have notes on the lines.
That's because the lines contain sounds through <unk> subtle <unk>
In <unk> culture is equivalent to sound.
This is the signal to <unk> in the <unk>
A typical <unk> has five lines.
However, for me, to do this with my thumb that doesn't feel natural.
That's why in my drawings I just have four lines on paper.
In the year 2008, I had the opportunity to travel to Berlin, Germany, for an artistic house there.
Before this time, I had worked as <unk>
During this summer, I visited museums and <unk> <unk> and as I went from one place to another, I realized that there was no visual art there.
At that time, the sound was the trend and that was called me <unk>
There was no visual art, everything was hearing.
Now the sound has entered my territory of art.
Is it going to be more about art?
I realized that it doesn't have to be like this.
In fact, I know the sound.
I know it so well that you don't just experience through your ears.
I can feel it <unk> or <unk> visually, or even like an idea.
So I decided to reclaim sound and <unk> in my art practice.
And everything that had taught me on the sound of sound, I decided to leave and <unk>
I started to create a new body of work.
And when I presented it to the art community, I was <unk> with the amount of support and attention that I got.
I realized sound is like money, power -- social currency.
In the back of my mind, I always felt like the sound was <unk> it was a <unk> person.
And the sound is so powerful that it could be <unk> to me and my artistic work, or I could <unk>
I chose to get <unk>
There's a massive culture around speech language.
And just because I don't use my literal voice to communicate, the eyes of society is as if I didn't have a voice at all.
So I have to work with people who can support me the same as and become my voice.
And so I'm able to be relevant in society today.
So in school, in work and institutions, work with many different performers from <unk>
And his voice becomes my voice and identity.
They help me be <unk>
And their voices have value and weight.
Ironically, by asking for <unk> your voices, I am able to maintain a temporary way of value like taking a loan.
If you won't continue with this practice, I feel that I could be <unk> on the <unk> and not having any social value.
So with sound like my new artistic medium, <unk> in the world of music.
And I was surprised to see the similarities between music and <unk>
For example, a musical note can't be capture and express fully on paper.
And the same can be said of a concept in <unk>
The two are very <unk> and highly <unk> which means that subtle changes can affect all the meaning as much as the signals like sounds.
I'd like to share with you a metaphor for the piano, to understand better how the <unk> works.
So, imagine a piano.
<unk> divide into a lot of different <unk>
If you take a fridge differently for each finger as the piano, like facial expression, the movement of the body, the movement of the body, the body, the shape of the hand and like that, as the piano, the English is a linear language, as if you were <unk> just a <unk>
However, the <unk> is more like a <unk> you need the 10 fingers in the way to express a clear concept or an idea of <unk>
If only a key, it would change the <unk> create a completely different meaning.
The same thing is happening with music in terms of tone and <unk> and volume.
In <unk> by using these different parameters -- you can actually express different ideas.
For example, the signal <unk> in it."
This is the signal <unk> in it."
I'm looking at you.
<unk> <unk>
Oh, I <unk>
<unk> oh.
What are you <unk>
Ah, <unk>
So I went to think, and if I look at the <unk> through your music?
If I had to create a sign and put it over and over and over again, it could be like a piece of visual music.
For example, this is the <unk> sign of the sun comes out and you're wearing.
This is all day."
If you get it out, and you break the speed, visually speed, it looks like a piece of music.
All day.
I feel that the same thing can be said to be said of <unk> the <unk>
"All <unk>
This is all night, in this drawing.
And this led me to thinking about three different types of <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk>  <unk> <unk>
I feel that the third one has more <unk> than the other two.
This represents how time is expressed in <unk> and how the distance to the body can express changes over time.
For example, one <unk> is a hand, two <unk> is two hands, the present gets closer and in front of the body, the future is in front of the body and the past is on the back.
So the first example is <unk> a lot of time."
Then, <unk> <unk> <unk> and the last one, which is my favorite, with a very romantic and dramatic idea at the same time again."
<unk> <unk> is a musical term with a particular rate of four times by <unk>
However, when I see the word <unk> <unk> I think automatically <unk>
Look at <unk> hand right, <unk> hand.
We have the <unk> through my head and the chest.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> I'm going to show you a way of hand called <unk> <unk>
Can you do it with me?
All of the hands in the ground.
Now we're going to do it both in my head like my chest, something like <unk> <unk> or <unk>
Yeah, very well.
That means <unk> in the international system.
The international system, as a note is a visual tool to help communicate in all cultures and languages of signs around the world.
The second one I'd like to show you is this one. Please do it with me again.
And now this.
It means <unk> in the <unk>
Now, the third. Please go back again.
And again.
It's <unk> in the <unk>
Let's do the three together.
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
Good job.
So look at how three signs are very similar to each other in your head and the chest. But they make a very different meanings out.
It's amazing to see how the <unk> is alive and wealthy as the music.
However, today, we live in a very <unk> world.
And just because the <unk> doesn't have <unk> automatically doesn't have social value.
We need to start questioning what defines social value and allow the <unk> to develop their own value, without sounds.
And this could be a step to make a more inclusive society.
And maybe people understand that you don't have to be deaf, to learn <unk> not that you have to hear music to learn music.
The <unk> is a rich trove -- and I'd like you to have the same experience.
I'd like to give you to open your ears, open your eyes, to participate in our culture and experience of our visual language.
And you never know, they can fall in love with us.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk> Hey, that's me.
As a child, my parents would say, "You can <unk> everything, but then you have to <unk>
The freedom involves responsibility.
But my imagination took me to all these wonderful places, where everything was possible.
So I grew up in an innocence or a bubble bubble -- I should say, because the adults would lie us to protect us from the horrible truth.
When I get older, I learned that adults also <unk> and that they're not very good at cleaning each other.
Last time, I am an adult and teach citizenship and invention in Hong Kong.
You don't have to wait long for my students to walk around the beach <unk> with lots of trash.
So as good citizens, <unk> the <unk> and no, it's not drinking alcohol, and if it is, I don't know it.
It's sad to say, but more than 80 percent of the oceans contain plastic.
It's a particular thing.
And in the last decades, we've been coming out with these big ships and networks, to collect those pieces of plastic to study them under the microscope, and the <unk> and <unk> this information on a map.
But it lasts an eternity and it's very expensive and it's also very expensive to use those huge boats as well.
So along with my students, with ages six to 15 years, we dream about inventing a better way.
We've transformed our tiny classroom in Hong Kong in a workshop.
We started building this <unk> <unk> job so that the kids very <unk> can also participate.
And I'm going to tell you the kids who are using electrical tools feel cool and secure.
Not exactly.
Let's go back to plastic.
We collect the plastic and we cut it down the size we find it in the ocean, which is very small, because of its <unk>
We do.
I leave it to the imagination of my students.
My job is to try to take the best ideas from every child and try to <unk> them into something that we hope to work.
We decided that instead of collecting pieces of plastic, just <unk> information.
So by using a robot, we took a picture of this <unk> the kids would get together a lot with robots.
And then we started quickly what we call "a <unk>
We're so fast in creating prototypes that we end up before lunch.
And we put light bulbs and web cameras on sidewalks and put it into a floating robot that goes slowly through the water and the plastic we have there, and this is the image captured by the robot.
We see the pieces of plastic floating slowly through the sensor while the computer on board process this image and measure the size of each <unk> to get an estimate of the amount of plastic in the water.
I took this invention step on a website for inventors called <unk> with hope that someone will make it even more.
The great thing about this project is that students saw a local problem, and <unk> are trying to fix it immediately.
I was looking at my <unk> problem, but my students in Hong Kong are very well <unk>
Do you see the news, they look at the Internet, and you go through this <unk>
A child, maybe less than 10 years old, cleaning up a oil spill, just using the hands, in <unk> the largest <unk> forest in the world in Bangladesh.
They were really surprised because this is the water you drink is the water that you can get away from the water where they get in place where they live.
You can also see that the water is brown and the mud and the oil is also brown color and when everything is used, it's very difficult to see what's in the water.
But there is a simple technology called <unk> which allows you to see what's in the water.
We built a first prototype of a <unk> which can be <unk> through all kinds of substances that produce different spectra -- which can help to identify what's in the water.
We put this prototype with a sensor and we sent it to Bangladesh.
The great thing about this project is that beyond solving a local problem, or to look at a local problem, and my students used their empathy and their sense of creativity to help other children.
I was forced to research a problem at <unk> I was forced to do a second experiment, and I wanted to go a little further, maybe to address a harder problem, and also closer to me.
I'm half Japanese and French half and maybe remember, in 2011, there was an devastating earthquake in Japan.
It was so violent that he started several giant waves called <unk> and those <unk> destroy several cities on the east coast of Japan.
More than 14,000 people died in a second.
It also gives the nuclear power plant from Fukushima, a nuclear power plant in the water.
And today, as a 300 metric tons are still <unk> of the nuclear plant in the Pacific Ocean.
Today, all the Pacific Ocean has traces of <unk>
If we go to the West Coast, we can measure the radiation radiation <unk> everywhere.
But if you look at the map, it seems that most of the radiation disappeared from the Japanese coast, and most of the time, it has a safe thing, it's blue.
Well, reality is a little bit more complicated than that.
I've become <unk> every year from the accident and research independently with other scientists, the land, the river, and this time we wanted to bring the kids.
Of course not the <unk> the parents don't <unk>
But every night we were looking at the center of <unk> here you see the use of different masks here.
It might seem like they didn't take the serious work, but they did it because they're going to have to live with the <unk> their whole life.
Along with them we discussed the data <unk> that day and we talked about what we were going to do next, the strategies, and so on.
And to do this, we created a <unk> map of the region around the plant of nuclear power.
We created the map of <unk> we introduced <unk> to represent real-time data in the <unk> and <unk> water to simulate the rain.
We were able to notice that the radioactive dust went down from the top of the mountain towards the <unk> system and <unk> in the ocean.
It was a <unk> estimate.
But based on this we organized an civil expedition the closest to the nuclear power to date.
We zoom in to 1.5 miles from the nuclear source, and with the fishermen help of the area were collecting sediments from the sea floor with a <unk> of sediment as we invented and built it.
Here we see a <unk> we've gone from a local problem to a remote problem to a global problem.
And it's been really exciting to work on these different scales, also with open-source technologies and really simple technologies.
But at the same time, it's been increasingly frustrating because we've only been starting to measure the harm that we've done.
We haven't even started trying to solve problems.
I wonder if we should take the leap and try to invent better ways to do all of these things.
So the classroom became so small, so we found an industrial installation in Hong Kong and turned it into the largest space dedicated to social and environmental impact.
It's in the middle of Hong Kong and it's a place where we can work with wood, metal, chemistry, a little bit of biology, basically can be built almost entirely there.
It's also a place where adults and children can play together.
It's a place where the dreams of children can actually become the help of adults, and where adults can be kids again.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> We asked things like, we can invent the future of mobility with <unk> energy.
For example.
Or well, we can help in the mobility of the advanced age transforming their standard chairs on new vehicles in new vehicles.
The plastic, oil and <unk> are <unk> terrible, but the worst legacy we can leave our children are lies.
We can't afford to protect the children of the horrible truth because we need their imagination to invent the solutions.
So scientists and scientists, creators, we should make the next generation to care about the environment and people, and to really do something about it.
Thank you.
Two <unk> <unk> two radically opposite culture.
One is made out of thousands of steel, the other one silk silk silk.
One of them is synthetic the other organic one.
One is the <unk> on the environment, the other thing he believed.
One is designed by nature, the other one for it.
Michelangelo said when he looked at the <unk> at a chance, he saw a figure that struggles to be free.
The <unk> was only a tool of <unk>
But the living creatures are not <unk>
They grow.
And in the smallest units of life, the cells, we have all the information required for each cell to work and to <unk>
The tools also have consequences.
At least since the Industrial Revolution, the world of design has been dominated by manufacturing and manufacturing and mass production.
The assembly lines have dictated a world made of parts, <unk> the imagination of designers and architects trained to think of their objects like <unk> <unk> with different functions.
But you don't find <unk> of <unk> material in nature.
Think of human skin, for example.
Our facial skins are thin with <unk> light-activated
The skin <unk> are more thick with little <unk>
You acts primarily like filter the other mainly as barrier, and yet it's the same <unk> there is no <unk>
It's a system that changes its functionality through variation in <unk>
Here's a broken screen, which represents my view of the world -- the double personality of every designer and an architect to work with the <unk> and the gene, between the machine and the organism, between the assembly and the organism, between Henry Ford and Charles Darwin.
These two visions of the world, my left hemisphere.
My job, on their simplest level, tries to bring these two visions of the world, away from assembly and approaching growth.
You probably ask, why now?
Why wasn't it that 10 or even five years?
We live in a very special moment in history, a rare moment, where we were doing four disciplines that offer designers access to the tools we never had access to before.
And at the intersection of these four fields, my team and I thought.
Please know the minds and my hands of my students.
We designed objects, products, structures and tools through large-scale scales -- like this robotic arm with a factor of 24 feet in diameter with a force that is not very far away to print <unk> buildings, and graphics made out of <unk> <unk> <unk> that glow in the dark.
So here we have <unk> the <unk> an archetype from the ancient Arab architecture, and it's created a screen where every single opening is all size to shape the shape of light and heat through it.
In our next project, we explore the possibility of creating a layer and a <unk> This was for a <unk> fashion fashion fashion -- they're <unk> It's like a second skin made from one piece, <unk> in the flexible <unk> around the waist.
Together with 3D printing collaborator <unk> we print this layer and 3D <unk> of the cells, I'll show you more objects like that.
This <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> <unk>
This is the resolution of a human hair.
It's also the resolution of a scanner <unk>
That designers have access to this high resolution <unk> and the <unk> instruments allow us to design products that are <unk> not only the way our bodies, but the physiological structure of our tissue.
We also designed a acoustic chair, a chair at the same and comfortable chair, and it absorbs sound.
The Carter teacher came back to the nature of <unk> and to design this pattern of <unk> surface becomes <unk>
It would be <unk> of 44 different properties of 44 different properties that vary in <unk> <unk> and color, forcing the pressure points in the human body.
Your surface, as in nature, varies its functionality not by addition to another material or another <unk> but <unk> continuously and <unk> the material property.
But it's nature <unk>
There's no parts in nature?
I wasn't raised in a religious Jewish home but when I was young, my grandmother told me stories about the Bible <unk> and one of them came to me and define a lot of what I really care about.
As she <unk> "In the third day of <unk> God sends the Earth to grow a <unk> tree.
For that first tree. <unk> there was no difference between trunk, double leaves and <unk>
All the tree was a flies.
Instead, the land did grow trees with branches, <unk> <unk> and flowers.
The Earth created a world made of place.
I often ask myself, "What would design look like if objects get made out of a piece of piece.
Do you take a better state of the <unk>
So we were looking for the material to do the kind of material of the tree <unk> with fruit and we found it.
The second <unk> most abundant <unk> on the planet is called <unk> and about 100 million tons of being produced every year by organisms like shrimp, mammalian <unk> and <unk>
We thought if we could tune in their properties, we could generate <unk> structures in a single piece.
So that's what we did.
We call it <unk> <unk>  <unk> a lot of <unk> <unk> <unk> and produced toothpaste.
<unk> chemical concentrations we've been able to achieve a wide range of properties, from dark, hard and <unk> to the soft and transparent.
To print the large-scale structures that was built a system with multiple <unk> <unk> <unk>
The robot could vary the properties of the material about the march and to create these structures made of a single new material -- 100 percent recycled.
When the pieces are lists, it leaves them to find a natural shape to contact with the air.
So why do we keep designing with <unk>
The air bubbles that were a byproduct of the <unk> process used to contain <unk> <unk> that first showed up on the planet three billion years ago, as we heard yesterday.
Together with our collaborators at Harvard and MIT -- the bacteria designed genetically engineered to capture carbon from the atmosphere and make it into sugar.
For the first time, we've been able to generate structures that make their transition without <unk> problems and if it grows even more, windows.
A <unk> tree.
Working with an ancient material, one of the first forms of life on the planet, with abundant water, and with a little bit of synthetic biology, we have transformed a structure that is made of <unk> of shrimp in an architecture that behaves like a tree.
And here's the best two: for objects designed to <unk> put in the sea, <unk> life and placed on the ground, help grow a tree.
<unk> for our next exploration using the same design principles was the solar system.
We're looking for the possibility to create clothes to keep life for <unk>
To do that, we must master bacteria and control their flow.
So as the <unk> table, we made our own table of elements -- new forms of life created <unk> made <unk> and <unk> <unk>
I like to think of synthetic biology like liquid production, only instead of <unk> metals -- new biological <unk> new biological <unk>
This is called <unk>
We <unk> our own 3D channels to control the flow of these crops.
In our first piece of clothing -- two microorganisms.
The first one is <unk>
It lives in our oceans and in the fresh water.
And the second, E. <unk> the bacteria that lives in the human intestine.
A light turns into sugar, the other consumes sugar and produces some useful biofuels for the built environment.
But these two <unk> don't interact in nature.
In fact, it never <unk>
They're here, designed for the first time, to have a relationship in a piece of clothes.
Think of it as evolution not natural selection, but evolution by design.
In order to contain these relationships, we have created a single channel that resembles the tract tract -- that will help you make these bacteria and make it <unk> their function of way.
So we started to grow those channels in the human body, <unk> the properties of the material according to the functionality <unk>
If we wanted more photosynthesis, it would be more transparent channels.
This <unk> system, when it stretches from one end to the other, it takes 60 meters.
This is half of the length of a football field, and 10 times more than our gut <unk>
And here it is, as <unk> at TED, our first <unk> channels bright <unk> channels in your clothes.
Thank you.
Mary <unk> said, "We are past creatures, only half is <unk>
What if designing the other <unk>
And if we could create structures that increase the matter.
And if we could create personal <unk> that <unk> our skin -- <unk> the aquatic tissue and <unk> our <unk>
Think of this as a form of editing biology.
I call this the material ecology of stuff.
To do that, you always have to go back to nature.
So now, you know that a 3D printer is actually printing the material in layers.
You also know that nature doesn't do that.
<unk> <unk> with <unk>
This cocoon of <unk> for example, creates a highly <unk> architecture a home within which they <unk>
<unk> <unk> about this level of <unk>
It does it by the combination of the combination of two materials, but of two proteins in different <unk>
One acts as a structure, the other is the glue or the matrix, or the matrix, which is the <unk>
And this happens through scales.
The silk worm actually turned into the environment, creates a <unk> structure, and then it starts <unk> a cocoon of compression.
The tension and the <unk> the two forces of life, manifest themselves in a single material.
In order to understand better how this complex process works, we attach a small magnet to the head of a silk worm to the <unk>
We put it inside a box with magnetic sensors, and that allowed us to create this cloud of points in three dimensions and visualize the complex architecture of cocoon of silk worm.
However, when you put the silk worm in a flat patch -- not within a box, we realized that you would have a cocoon and still <unk> <unk>
So we started designing different <unk> different <unk> and we've discovered that the shape, the composition, the <unk> structure was passed directly by the environment.
They often get rid of the silk worms to death within their <unk> their silk is <unk> and it's used in the <unk> industry.
We saw that designing these templates can be able to shape raw silk without boiling a single <unk>
It was <unk> <unk> and we could create these things.
So we climbed this process to the architectural scale.
We had a robot <unk> by making silk templates and we put it on our site.
We knew that silk worms went towards dark areas and <unk> so we used a road diagram to reveal the distribution of light and heat in our structure.
So we create holes or <unk> to block the rays of light and heat into the silk worms over the structure.
We were prepared to get <unk>
We wanted to ask ourselves, silk worms to a online silk farm online.
And after <unk> four weeks, they were prepared to get them to <unk> with us.
We put them carefully on the lower edge of the <unk> and as they <unk> <unk> they got <unk> and the life starts again, like us, but much, much longer.
Buckminster Fuller said that tension is the great integrity, and it was right.
When you look at biological silk on <unk> <unk> <unk> they give all this pavilion for its integrity.
And over two or three weeks, we got worms of <unk> <unk>
In a curious symmetry, this is also the length of the path of silk.
<unk> after the <unk> produce 1.5 million eggs.
This could be used for 250 <unk> in the future.
So here are the two visions of the world.
A silk <unk> through a robotic arm, the other full gaps.
If the last frontier of design is to give life to products and the buildings around us to form an ecology of two materials, designers must bring these two visions of the world.
Which brings us around, of course, at the beginning.
Here is a new era of design, a new era of creation, which brings us from a design inspired in nature to a nature inspired by design, which demands for us, for the first time, to take care of nature.
Thank you.
Thank you very much. Thank you.
Raise your hand if you've ever asked them what you want to be from <unk>
If you had to remember what age they had when they first asked this?
They can match your fingers.
Three. Five. Five. Five.
Now, raise your hand if the question is, "What do you want to be from <unk>
It has caused some kind of anxiety.
Any anxiety of anxiety.
I'm somebody who could never answer the question, "What do you want to be from <unk>
The problem wasn't that I had no interest, but I had <unk>
In school I liked the English -- the <unk> and the art and the art and he took the websites, and I also played the guitar in a punk band, called <unk> <unk>
Maybe you've heard about us.
And generally I like to try and persist anyway, for having spent a lot of time and energy and sometimes money in this field.
But with the time this feeling of boredom, this feeling of, this is no longer challenge, comes to <unk>
And I have to go on.
But then I get married for something else, a whole different thing, and I would focus on it, and I'm going to be <unk> and I have found <unk> and then again this point where I start to <unk>
And finally, I want to give it up.
But then I'd like to discover something new and different, and I'd like to go into that.
This pattern made me a lot of anxiety, for two reasons.
The first one was because I wasn't sure how I was going to turn all this into a career.
I thought I should choose one thing, deny all of my other passions, and <unk>
Another reason why it made me so much anxiety was a little bit more personal.
I was worried there was something wrong with this, and something wrong with me for not <unk> at all.
I was concerned with commitment, or to be dispersed, or <unk> or to my own success.
If you can relate my story and these feelings, I would like to ask you something I'd like to ask you something I'd like to get back then.
<unk> themselves, where they learned to assign the meaning of evil or abnormal to do things.
I'm going to tell you where they did it, they learned from culture.
We ask first of what you want to be from <unk>
We have about five years.
And the truth is that nobody cares about what they were going to do?"
It's considered a naive question to cause beautiful answers on children like, <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> or <unk>
<unk> the <unk> of <unk> here.
So this question is given us again and again as we grow in various ways, <unk> <unk> to high school students are asking them to pick them out of college.
And at some point, what do you want to be from <unk>
It happens to be the nice exercise of before what the dream.
Why?
If this issue inspired kids to dream with what they might be, don't inspire to dream with everything they might be.
In fact, it does just just the opposite, because when someone asks you what you want to be, you can't respond to 20 different things, even though adults are very <unk> maybe <unk> and say, "Oh, what cute, but you can't be a <unk> <unk> <unk>
You have to <unk>
This is Dr. Bob <unk>  And he's a <unk> <unk> <unk>
And this Amy <unk> editor turned into <unk> <unk> a teacher and creative director.
But most children don't hear about people like this.
Everything you hear is they will have to choose.
But it's more than that.
The notion of life <unk> is very <unk> in our culture.
It's this idea of fate or the real <unk> the idea that each of us has something to spend during their time on this land, and you have to figure out what that thing is and devote your life to it.
But if you're somebody who is not connected to this way?
What if there are many different issues that wake up their curiosity and many different things that want to do?
There's no place for somebody in that framework.
And so you can feel alone.
You can feel that it doesn't have a goal.
And I feel something wrong with you.
There's nothing wrong with you.
You're a <unk>
A <unk> is someone with many interests and creative activities.
It's a breath to say.
It could help if you divide into three <unk> multiple potential and <unk>
You can also use other terms of <unk> the same idea, like <unk> <unk>
Over the Renaissance time the ideal was the one who was well <unk> in multiple disciplines.
Barbara <unk> refers to us as <unk>
<unk> whatever you like or <unk> your own.
It seems to me as a kind of adapt to a community, we can't agree with a single identity.
It's easy to see the <unk> like limitation or <unk> you must win.
But what I've learned about talking to people and writing about these ideas on my website, is that there are huge strengths in this way.
Here's three superpowers <unk>
One, the synthesis of ideas.
I mean, the combination of two or more fields and the creation of something new in the <unk>
<unk> <unk> and Rachel <unk> <unk> their shared interests in cartography, visualization data, traveling and design and design, by discovering <unk>
<unk> is a company that creates inspired jewelry jewelry <unk>
At <unk> and Rachel came up with this unique idea by its <unk> mix of skills and experiences.
The innovation is happening at intersections.
So there come new ideas.
And the <unk> with all their background, can access a lot of these points of <unk>
The second superpower, <unk> is fast learning.
When we <unk> we <unk> we are going to do that.
We look at everything we can have in our hands.
We're used to <unk> for having been a lot of times in the past, and this means we have less afraid of testing new things and out of our comfort.
A lot of skills are <unk> to other disciplines, and we bring everything that we have learned to every new area that <unk> so we rarely start from scratch.
<unk> <unk> is a full-time <unk> and <unk>
As a little girl, <unk> an amazing capacity to develop muscle memory.
Now, she's the fastest <unk>
Before it turned into the writer, I was <unk> <unk>
It had to learn the smallest sales mechanics when they started their thumb, and this ability helps to write compelling launches for the editors.
It rarely is a loss of time to go to what you would give you even if at the end of it.
It's possible to apply that knowledge in a completely different field, in a way that you could not have <unk>
The third superpower, <unk> is the adaptability. That is, the ability to turn into anything you need in a <unk> situation.
<unk> <unk> is sometimes the director of videos, others, a web designer, sometimes a Kickstarter, sometimes teacher, and, sometimes, when James <unk>
It's valuable because it makes a good job.
He's even more valuable because it can take many different roles depending on the needs of their clients.
<unk> Magazine defined adaptability as the most important ability for development, to thrive in the 21st century.
The economic world changes so rapidly and <unk> that are the individuals and organizations that can be able to do to meet the needs of the market needs -- which really <unk>
<unk> of ideas, fast learning and <unk> three skills where <unk> are very <unk> and three skills that you could lose if you're a drug to reduce their goals.
As a society, we have a great interest in encouraging <unk> to be themselves.
We have complex problems -- <unk> right now, and we need creative thinkers.
Let's say they are, in your heart, specialists.
<unk> the belly knowing that they wanted to be <unk> <unk>
Don't worry, there's nothing wrong with you.
In fact, some of the best teams get up with a specialist and a <unk> <unk>
The specialist can dive deep and put in ideas, and the <unk> offers a amplitude of knowledge to the project.
It's a beautiful relationship.
But we should all design lives and careers that are dealing with how we are connected.
And unfortunately, the <unk> in a large part of them are told that they're simply more like their <unk> <unk>
Once I said this, if there's one thing that you take from this talk, I hope it's this: <unk> with inner wiring whatever it is.
If you are a heart specialist then <unk> for all the media.
That's where you will give the best of it.
But for the <unk> in the room, including those that you just realized being one of them in the last 12 minutes,  I said, <unk> with your many passions.
Keep his curiosity through those <unk> <unk>
The intersections.
<unk> our inner wiring leads to a more authentic and happy life.
And perhaps most importantly, we will have the world <unk>
Thank you.
In the year of <unk> a woman named <unk> they took a psychiatric to a <unk>
<unk> <unk> and I couldn't remember even the most basic details of your life.
His doctor was called <unk>
<unk> I didn't know how to help <unk> but <unk> for her, until he was passed away in <unk>
After his death, <unk> did a find, and they found strange plates and <unk> in the brain of a guy who had never seen before.
The most amazing thing.
If I had to have been living today, we couldn't give her to her more help than he was <unk> he gave him <unk> years ago.
<unk> was Dr. <unk> Alzheimer's.
And <unk> <unk> the first patient to receive a diagnosis that we now call Alzheimer's disease.
From <unk> medicine has advanced hard.
They have found antibiotics and vaccines to protect ourselves from <unk> many treatments for cancer, <unk> for HIV, <unk> for <unk> and much more.
But it has been progress in treating Alzheimer's.
I'm part of a team of scientists who work to find a cure for Alzheimer's for over a decade.
So I think about this all the time.
Alzheimer's now affects 40 million around the world.
But by 2050, it will affect 150 million that, by the way, to include many of you.
If you're expecting to live to age 85 or more, the possibility of Alzheimer's will be almost one of each two.
In other words, there's the chance that they spend their years or Alzheimer's or helping to take care of a friend or loved with Alzheimer's disease.
In the U.S., Alzheimer's care costs 200 billion dollars every year.
One of five dollars of healthcare is spent on Alzheimer's disease.
Today is the most expensive disease and its costs -- a rise of five times in 2050, as the generation of the so-called boom.
It may surprise you, but Alzheimer's is one of the biggest social challenges and social challenge of our generation.
But it's made relatively little to <unk>
Today, one of the top 10 causes of death around the world, Alzheimer's is the only one that you can't afford to cure or even slow its development.
We understand less from Alzheimer's than other diseases because we've invested less time and money on the research.
The U.S. government spends 10 times every year in cancer cancer than in Alzheimer's percent of the fact that it costs us more Alzheimer's and causes a similar number of deaths like cancer.
The lack of resources are due to a more fundamental cause, the lack of consciousness.
Because this is what time people knows, but everyone <unk> Alzheimer's is a disease, and we can <unk>
For most of the last couple of years, all of the last couple of years, even scientists, <unk> Alzheimer's with aging.
We think that will be <unk> in a normal and inevitable part of aging.
But you only have to look at a picture of a aged old brain compared to a Alzheimer's patient to see the real physical damage caused by this disease.
In addition to trigger a severe loss of memory and mental skills, the damage to the brain caused for significantly life expectancy and it's always deadly.
Remember, Dr. Alzheimer's came up and <unk> strangers in the brain of <unk> a century ago.
For almost a century, we didn't know much about this.
We now know that they're made of protein molecules.
You can think of a protein molecule like a piece of paper that folds like origami.
There are places in the paper that are <unk>
And when it <unk> well, these dots are happening inside the inside.
But sometimes things go wrong, and some dots are left on the outside.
This makes the protein molecules <unk> each other, forming groups that can form big plates and <unk>
That's what we see in the brain of patients with Alzheimer's.
We've spent the last 10 years at the University of Cambridge trying to understand how this <unk> works.
There are many steps, and the identification of what step is complex, as a bomb.
<unk> a cable could do nothing.
<unk> others can make the bomb explode.
You have to find the right step that it will happen, and then create a drug that does it.
Until recently, in its most part, they have reduced the wires and expected the best.
But now there are a diverse group of people, doctors, biologists, even, chemicals, physical and mathematician.
And together, we have managed to identify a critical step in the process. It's now testing a new kind of drugs that block specifically this step to stop the disease.
Let me show you some of our latest results.
No one out of our lab has seen it yet.
Let's see a few videos of what happened to try these drugs in <unk>
These are the healthy worms and you can see that they move normally.
These worms on the other hand, have protein molecules that they stick into each other within them, like humans with Alzheimer's.
And you can see they're clearly sick.
But by giving our new drugs to these worms at an early stage, then we see that <unk> and live a normal life.
This is just a positive outcome, but research as this shows that Alzheimer's is a disease that we can understand and cure.
After <unk> years of wait, there's real hope that can be achieved in the next 10 or 20 years.
But so that it grows that hope, to defeat Alzheimer's disease, we need help.
It's not about scientists like me, it's about you.
We need to be <unk> that Alzheimer's is a disease and that if you get it, we can <unk>
In the case of other diseases, the patients and their families have flooding, more research and <unk> pressure about governments, pharmaceutical industry, and <unk>
That was essential to move forward into HIV treatment in the late 1980s.
Today we see that same unit to overcome cancer.
But Alzheimer's patients often can't talk for themselves.
And their families, the hidden, hidden, of their loved ones and day and night, they're often too much <unk> to go out and advocate for change.
So it really depends on you.
Alzheimer's is not in most cases a genetic disease.
All the world with a brain runs the risk.
Today, there are 40 million patients today, and they can't create the change that they need for themselves.
They were talking about them, to help demand a cure.
Thank you.
I published this article in the Eastern <unk> column in January of this year.
To fall in love with somebody, I do this.
The paper is about a psychological study that is designed to create romantic love in the lab, and my own experience when we tested it myself one night last summer.
So the procedure is pretty simple: Two strangers are <unk> to get 36 questions more and more personal questions, and then both look at the eyes without talking for four minutes.
Here's a couple of questions for example.
Number <unk> If you could wake up tomorrow with one quality or skill, which would be?
Number <unk> When was the last time you would go to someone else?
And <unk>
<unk> <unk> these are increasingly personal ones.
Number <unk> <unk> really <unk> me to your partner what you like to him, or she said, I know very honest this time, and I gave things that you don't say anyone you've ever met.
When I came across this study a few years ago, a detail really struck me the question that two of the participants had married six months later and invited all of the lab to the ceremony.
So it was <unk> about this process of making romantic love, but of course, it was also <unk>
And when I had a chance to test this study, with someone who knew not particularly well, I didn't expect to be <unk>
However, we were <unk> and --  And I thought it was a good story, so I send it to the column.
And that was published in January, and now it's already <unk> so I guess some of you are probably asking you -- they follow together <unk>
And the reason I think you're asking for this is because you've done this question over and over again in the last seven months.
And this question is just what I want to talk about today.
But let's go back to the subject.
A week before the paper was <unk> was very nervous.
I had been working in a romantic book over the last few years, so I had encouraged me to write about my experience in romantic love on my blog.
But a blog entrance can come to a few hundred views as a lot, and those were usually from my Facebook friends and imagined that my paper in the New York Times would probably have thousands of views.
And that took a good charge of attention in a relatively new relationship.
But I had no idea.
The article was released on Friday at night, and I already had a Saturday, which happened in my blog.
And the Sunday, I had called the Today I lived, <unk> and "Good <unk> <unk>
In a month, the article received over eight million pages, and I was, by saying something, little prepared for this kind of attention.
One thing is to foster trust by writing today about own experiences, but another thing is to discover that the love life of one has been international news -- and that people around the world are really interested in the state of your new relationship.
And when people were calling or they were writing what they did for weeks, for weeks, they asked the same question: I still go together?
In fact, when I was preparing this talk, I did a quick search for my email in my email with the phrase, <unk> <unk>
And several messages appeared immediately.
They were from students and journalists and strange ones like this.
I was interviewed on radio and <unk>
Even I gave a talk, and a woman interviewed the stage, "Hey <unk> where is your <unk>
And I immediately put a red.
I understand that this is part of the deal.
If you write about your relationship in an international newspaper, you should expect people to feel comfortable asking about it.
But I was not prepared for the wingspan of the answer.
The 36 questions seemed to have <unk> life.
In fact, the New York Times published a <unk> article for San <unk> which included the experience of readers by testing the study in them with different degrees of success.
So, my first urge to all this attention was to be very <unk> with my own relationship.
I said not to every request that both of us did a public emergence together.
<unk> TV interviews, and <unk> orders of pictures of us two.
I believe that I was afraid of becoming the icons of the <unk> <unk> <unk> and a range of that I didn't feel at the absolute <unk>
And I understand that people didn't want to know only if the study worked -- they wanted to know if I was really <unk> I mean, if it was able to produce love <unk> not just a adventure, but real love, love <unk>
But this was a question I didn't feel able to respond.
My relationship was just a few months, and I felt, especially the people made the wrong question.
How do you know if you were going together or not, and also <unk>
If the answer was not, it would make the experience of doing these 36 questions less interesting?
Dr. Arthur <unk> wrote first about these questions in this same study in 1997. And there, the researcher was not producing romantic love.
Instead of that, I was looking for interpersonal <unk> between college students, using what <unk> called <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Sounds familiar, right?
But the study worked.
The participants became closer to the <unk> several <unk> studies, they used the <unk> protocol of <unk> as a rapid way of creating trust and interaction between strangers.
They have been used by members of the police and the community. And they've used it between people of opposite policies.
The original version of the story, which I tried in last summer, who combines personal questions with four visual contact, was cited in this article, but unfortunately it never <unk>
A few months ago, I was giving a talk in a little <unk> university university, and then a student came up to me and said to me, and he said to me, <unk> the study and didn't work.
He seemed like <unk> for it.
And I said, "You want to say that you would tell you the person who you do it."
Well he made a <unk>
I think she just wants us to be friends.
And I said, but became better friends?
<unk> that we did have managed to get better out of testing the <unk>
The <unk>
So, <unk> I said.
However, I don't think that was the answer that he was looking for.
In fact, I don't think it's the answer that none of you are looking for when it comes to love.
I came across the study for the first time when I was 29 -- and I was going through a really tough separation to me.
I'd had that relationship since 20, which was all of my adult life, and he was my first real love, and I had no idea how or could I live without it.
So I was focusing on science.
And I did everything I could find on the science of romantic love, and I expected that that could sort of take the heart.
I don't know if I realized this at the time, I thought I just did it for the book that I write but in retrospect, it seems really <unk>
I thought that if I was obsessed with the knowledge of romantic love, I would never have to feel as bad and used as I was then.
And all this knowledge has been useful in one way or another.
I'm more patient with love. I'm more <unk>
I have more confidence in demand for what I go.
But I can also see me more clearly and I can realize that what I'm looking for is sometimes more than reasonably than reasonably to demand me to me.
What I look for for love is a <unk> not just to be <unk> today and being <unk> tomorrow, but I'm going to continue to be <unk> within the person I love.
It may be the guarantee that people ask when they wanted to know if we were still together.
The story that the media told them about 36 questions is that there might be a shortcut to <unk>
There may be a way to somehow mitigate some ways to mitigate some of the <unk> and this is a very <unk> story because they love us to feel beautifully, but it's also terrifying.
But I think when it comes to love, we're very willing to accept the short version of history.
The story version of the story is, still together?
And their content with an answer of Yes or No.
So more than a question, let me ask questions like, how do you decide who deserves your love and who doesn't?
How are you going to stay in love when things were <unk> and how to know when to cut and <unk>
How do you live with uncertainty that inevitably leads to a relationship? Or even more, how you live in your <unk>
I don't know necessarily the answers to these questions, but I think they're a good beginning to have a more <unk> conversation about what to love with someone.
So if you want the brief version of my relationship, it's <unk> a year ago, a known time, and I apply a study designed to create romantic love, we are eating ourselves together, and I'm very <unk>
But fall in love is not the same thing to remain <unk>
<unk> is the easy part.
So at the end of my article <unk> Love didn't happen.
<unk> fell in love because we took the choice to be.
And I <unk> a little bit about reading it now, not because at the time, there was no idea everything that is supposed to be supposed to be.
I didn't have a number of times, we would have both of you to make that decision, and how much times I will have to keep doing that choice without knowing before he will always choose or not.
I want you to be enough to have done and responded to 36 questions, have I chosen to love someone so and kind of fun and expressed that choice in the largest newspaper in the United States.
But what I've done, instead is turning my relationship into the kind of myth that I don't really do.
And what I would do, and what maybe will happen my life is that that myth is true.
I want the happy ending implicit in the title of my paper, which is, by the way, the only part of the paper that I didn't actually wrote.
But what I have in change is the opportunity to choose to love someone, and the hope that he also love, and it is <unk> but that's the deal with love.
Thank you.
I was raised by a lesbian full <unk> and in a way I got a <unk> of the forest.
The city of New York ago, a time ago,  -- something that really affected me but more details later on.
I'll start with when I was eight years old.
I took a wooden box, and you put it up a dollar, a dollar, and a fork in it somewhere in Colorado.
And I thought that some strange <unk> or some aliens found this box about 500 years later and <unk> how our kind of <unk> ideas, for example, how we eat <unk>
I had no idea.
Anyway, it has <unk> because here I am, 30 years later, and I'm still doing boxes.
At a moment I was in <unk> <unk> like to go from <unk> and do <unk> and all of those things -- and I was doing a little girl for my mother.
And I took a dictionary and I took her all the pages and made a kind of <unk> <unk> the style Agnes Martin, I covered the <unk> and a bee <unk>
Well, my mother is afraid to the bees and it is <unk> them to them, so I added more resin on the canvas, thinking I could do it.
Instead, it happened, somehow it seemed like a size, as if it was that I would take the text with a <unk>
So I did. I built more boxes.
This time, I started to add some electronic elements, weird frogs that I was finding out by the street, all I could find, because I was looking for things all my life, trying to <unk> and tell stories about these objects.
So I got to draw around the objects, and I realized that God was my drawing in space.
I can flow <unk> drawing the same as a <unk> <unk> in the crime scene.
And I pulled out the objects and created my own taxonomy of suffering <unk>
First of all, they will be able to make an idea.
Then I did some insects and strangers.
It was really fun to draw in the layers of <unk>
And it was great, because I started building exhibitions and those things, and I was making some money, to take my girlfriend over for example, to go to <unk>
It was great man.
And at some point I was interested in the human form, sculptures of resin size <unk> with drawings of human beings within layers.
It was great, except for one thing: <unk> me.
I didn't know what to do, because it was going to kill me.
And I was going to bed every night thinking about it.
So I tried to use glass.
I started drawing in the glass layers, similar to a drawing on a window, then in another window, and another window, and he had all these windows together that are kind of a three-dimensional composition on.
And this really worked -- and so I could stop using the <unk>
So I did this for years, and my work <unk> with something very big -- I call <unk>
For <unk> I was inspired by the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> which is a painting at the Museum of <unk> in Spain.
You know it?
Well, it's a fantastic picture.
They say it's a little bit ahead of your time.
Well, the <unk> <unk> this piece.
It weighs 11 pounds.
5.5 feet long.
It has double face, so it's 10 feet of composition.
It's a little bit weird.
Well, that's the blood source.
On the left, it's Jesus and the <unk>
There's a cave where all these creatures with animals are travel between two worlds.
They go from the world of representation, to this <unk> <unk> <unk>
Here is where creatures with heads of animals are heading to the <unk> lists to kill in mass <unk> in the ocean.
The ocean is comprised of thousands of elements.
This is a <unk> god tied to a <unk>
Billy Graham in the <unk> The <unk> -- the <unk> platform of the <unk> <unk> the shelter.
Anyway, also sort of a <unk>
It's coming out of the ocean, and it spits out oil in a hand while the other hand comes out clouds.
Their hands are like <unk> and it looks like a <unk> that keeps the Earth and the cosmos in balance.
So it's a aspect of the <unk>
It's a little bit of story.
That's the hand in which you <unk>
And then when you go on the other hand, it has a <unk> like a bird <unk> and it spits out this <unk>
It also has a <unk> tail, a <unk> tail that unites the <unk>
Anyway, his tail turn on fire on a <unk>
I don't know why it happened.
Things that go, you know.
His tail ends up in a <unk> eye of <unk> made of terrorist cards.
They have <unk> them.
They were done in the 1980s, as if they were baseball cards.
All of your time.  This brings me to my last project.
I'm in the middle of two <unk> One is called <unk>
This is a six-year-old project to make 100 of these human beings.
Each one is a file of our culture, through media and material -- whether they're <unk> dictionaries.
But each one acts as a kind of archive in the way of being human, and they travel in groups of 20, four or 12 at the time.
They are like cells, they come together, they get together.
And you can walk between them. It's getting years.
Each one is basically a <unk> microscope that weighs 1.3 pounds of a human with a human <unk>
This has a little cave on my chest.
That's the <unk> he's the chest, you can <unk> the entrance to it.
I will tell you for the rest of the body -- there's a waterfall that comes out of the chest, and you cover it or <unk> or whatever it has, a kind of <unk> thing.
It's a quick refresher on these works because I can't do it for a long time.
We have layers, you can see.
This is a game in half.
This is two heads -- and it's communicating between two.
There are some pills coming out and come into the head of this strange <unk>
There's a little forest scene inside the <unk> <unk>
Can you imagine?
Anyway, this talk is about these boxes, just as the boxes we live in.
We're in a box, the solar system is a box.
This brings me to my last box.
It's a <unk> box called <unk> <unk>
Within this box there is a physicist, a neuroscientist, a musician, a <unk> a musician, a <unk> a writer, a <unk> an editorial arm that spreads all the content that we do in the world; and a garden.
It <unk> the box and all the people inside hits each other as particles.
And I think that's the way to change the world.
When you <unk> who is and the box that is living in.
And together we get to realize that we're all together in this, that this illusion that we are different, these concepts of the countries, of the borders, it doesn't work.
We're all very made of the same matter and in the same box.
And if we don't start trading those things with sweetness and <unk> we're all going to die very soon.
Thank you very much.
What do you do when your head?
They take a <unk>
But so that this pill has effect against pain, first of the stomach, the intestines and other organs.
And I'll take a pill is the most effective and <unk> system for any drug that any drug is going on in the body.
The <unk> however, is that the <unk> any drug is <unk>
And this is a big problem, especially in HIV patients.
When you take drugs -- they serve to decrease the amount of viruses in the blood, and to increase <unk> cells.
But they are also known for their side effects on their negative, because in the time that it takes to the current current. It becomes <unk> and worse even for the time that it takes to get to their destiny, which is where it's most importantly, in HIV HIV.
These are regions of the body like the lymph <unk> the lungs, the lungs, where the virus is <unk> and it doesn't easily go into the blood flow of patients that are <unk> to the regular therapy with antiretroviral drugs.
However, behind the treatment, the virus can wake up and infect new cells.
This is the big problem with HIV treatment with the drugs that are a life treatment that is run by oral <unk>
One day, I sat down, and I thought, <unk> to make the treatment directly into the virus, without the risk of <unk> of <unk>
As a scientist in <unk> the answer was in front of me, the <unk> of course.
If you use them in <unk> for wounds and wounds and diabetes -- they can be used for anything <unk> including the drug transport of drugs.
In fact, we're already using pulses of laser to open or drill into extremely small holes, that open and closing almost immediately the cells infected with HIV to introduce drugs.
The best people are ask, "How is it <unk>
We sent a little powerful beam laser on the infected cell cell infected in HIV while these cells are embedded in a liquid that contains the drug.
The laser through the cell, while the cell absorbs the drug in a matter of <unk>
Before you even notice, the hole is <unk> immediately.
We're testing this technology in vitro or plate plates, but the goal is to bring this technology into the human body, apply to the human body.
"How is that <unk> you can ask.
Well, the answer is: through three heads.
With the first head, it's our laser, we will do a <unk> on the site.
The second head, which is a camera, it goes into the site.
Finally, the third head, a <unk> which distributes the drug, it releases it directly into the site of infection, while the laser is used again to keep cell cells.
Well, this doesn't seem a lot of time.
But one day, if it's successful, this technology can lead to total eradication of HIV in the body.
Yeah. A cure for HIV.
This is the dream of every researcher of the <unk> in our case, a laser treatment.
Thank you.
In the last decade, I've been studying armed groups -- no armed organizations like terrorists, or <unk> or <unk>
<unk> what these groups are doing when they're not shoot out.
My goal is to understand better to these reproductive agents of violence and study ways to encourage the transition from violent participation to the nonviolent <unk>
I do the field work in the world of politics and the library.
Understanding these groups is key to solving almost all conflict in course, because the war has changed.
It used to be a dispute between states.
Not anymore.
It's now a conflict between states and non-state actors.
For example, from the <unk> arrangements of peace <unk> between 1975 and 2011, <unk> were signed between a state and a non-governmental actor.
So we have to understand these <unk> even we should be <unk> or <unk> in any very successful conflict process of successful conflict.
But how do you do it?
We have to know what motivates these organizations.
We know very well the reasons why they do it, but no one looks at what they do when they don't exist.
The armed struggle.
Everything is part of the same organization.
We can't understand these groups, not much less <unk> without a global worldview.
The armed groups of today are complex organizations.
For example, <unk> <unk> known for their violent California against Israel.
From its creation in the 1980s, <unk> has also established a political party, a network of social services and a military device.
Similarly, the Palestinian <unk> known for their suicide attacks -- against Israel, also runs the <unk> of Gaza since 2007.
So these groups make more than just shooting.
Are multitasking multitasking things.
It <unk> a complex machinery of <unk> radio stations channels on television, web websites and strategies on social networks.
And here you have the <unk> magazine <unk> in English and published in <unk>
The armed groups also invest in a complex fundraising fundraising funds but through <unk> businesses for example, construction companies.
These activities are key.
They allow these groups to increase their strength, increase their <unk> to better recruit them to better and build their brand.
The armed groups also do something else, create stronger ties with their population investing in social services.
They build schools, run hospitals, put them in professional training programs or <unk>
<unk> offers all these services and more.
The armed groups are also trying to conquer the population by offering something that the state will not give us safety and protection.
The rise of the Taliban in a Afghanistan -- the rise of the war or even the beginning of the ascent of <unk> can also be able to see the efforts of these groups for delivering safety.
Unfortunately, in these cases, security has a higher price for the population.
But in general, providing social services that means filling a vacuum, a <unk> gap by the government, and allow these groups to develop and increase their power.
For example, the election victory in 2006 from Palestinian <unk> can't understand without recognizing the social work of the group.
It's a really complex scenario -- even in the West, when we look at <unk> groups, we just think about the violent side.
But that's not enough to understand the strengths of these groups, strategy or long-term vision.
These groups are <unk>
<unk> because they include gaps supported by the government, and emerge as armed groups and political groups are involved in nonviolent struggle and they give the governance.
And the more complex and sophisticated sophisticated these organizations, we can make it as opposed to a state.
How do you call a group like <unk>
They have been part of a territory, running all of his <unk> collect the trash, running the <unk> system.
It's a state? It's a <unk> group.
Or maybe it's something else, something new and different.
And what is <unk>
The lines are <unk>
We live in a world of states, <unk> nations and hybrids and the weaker they are the states, as in the Middle East today, the more progress and they fill that gap online actors.
This is important for governments, because to counter these groups are going to have to invest more in no military tools.
<unk> that governance gap has to be in the center of any sustainable approach.
This is very important to establish and put peace.
If we understand better groups to <unk> we will better understand what incentives to offer to encourage the transition from violence to violence.
In this new dispute between states and non-state actors, the military power can win some <unk> but not to give us peace and stability.
In order to achieve these goals we need long-term investments to fill in that safety vacuum that allowed these groups to thrive in a beginning.
Thank you.
I'm a failure as a woman, and as a feminist.
My opinions about gender equality are <unk> but I'm afraid they accept the <unk> label it would be unfair for the <unk>
I'm <unk> but pretty bad.
And so I felt like a bad feminist.
Or, at least, I wrote a paper, and a book called "The <unk> and then in interviews, people started to call me the <unk> <unk>
So what started as a personal joke meant to myself and a <unk> <unk> has become a bigger thing.
Let me take a step back.
When I was a young man, especially in my youth and the 20 years, I had strange ideas about the <unk> these women who were working with men and they hated sex. As if that was a bad thing.
Today, I see how women are treated all over the world and anger, in particular, like a perfectly reasonable response.
But at the time, I was worried about the tone that I was using people to <unk> which could be a feminist.
Being labeled as a feminist was a <unk> a taboo word and unpleasant.
I was <unk> as a woman who doesn't follow the rules, he asks too much, with high self-esteem and <unk> to believe that it's equal or superior to a man.
Nobody wants to be that <unk> woman until you realize that it's actually that woman, and you can't imagine being another person.
Over time, as I was growing, I started accepting that I am, in fact, guilty, and also proud to be.
For me, certain claims are <unk> women are equal to men.
I would have the same wages for the same work.
We have the right to travel around the world as <unk> free or violence.
We have the right to use easy and accessible to contraceptives and services.
We have the right to decide about our bodies, without <unk> controls or doctrines <unk>
We have the right to respect.
There's more.
When you talk about the needs of women, you have to realize our other <unk>
We're not just women.
We are people with a different body, gender expression and religion and <unk> social condition, and much more.
We need to have to account these differences and how we behave in the same way that matters what we have in common.
Without this kind of <unk> our feminism is nothing.
For me, these truths are <unk> but to be clear: I'm a disaster.
I'm full of contradictions.
There's a lot of things that make me a bad feminist.
I have another confession.
When I lead to work, I hear rap music <unk> all volume.
Although the letter degrades the women and I promised me, the classic <unk> <unk> of the Yin yang <unk> is incredible.
Do you actually have your <unk>
<unk> <unk>
Think about it.
<unk> poetry, right?
I'm completely overwhelmed by my musical signals.
I firmly believe in the work of man, which is all I don't want to do, <unk> -- all the <unk> but also killing insects, the collection of garbage care and <unk> maintenance and <unk>
I don't want to have anything to do with that.
The pink is my favorite color.
<unk> of fashion magazines and the nice things.
I can see "The <unk> and the <unk> <unk> and I have erotic fantasies of fairies tales that make it happen.
Some of my crimes are more <unk>
If a woman wants to adopt the name of his husband, it's his choice, and I'm not who to <unk>
If a woman decides to stay home to raise their children, I hate that choice, too.
The problem is not that it becomes economically vulnerable by this same choice, the problem is that our society is <unk> so it makes women economically economically vulnerable when they <unk>
So we got this problem.
<unk> feminism has been ignored or <unk> historically, the needs of women of color, the gay workers, and <unk> for white, <unk> <unk>
<unk> if that's a good feminism -- I'm a very bad feminist here.
The next thing happens is, as <unk> I feel a lot of pressure.
We have this trend of <unk> <unk> <unk>
We hope that we are going to be <unk>
When we were <unk> with a lot of taste from the same <unk> where the <unk>
As I said, I am a <unk> I actually consider myself to be <unk> from that <unk> before you try to get there.
<unk> women, particularly innovative and leaders of the sector, are afraid of being tagged as <unk>
They are afraid to stand up and say, "Yes, I am a fear of fear of what that <unk> means that meant that we could not be able to meet with a little bit realistic.
Let's take <unk> or like I call it, <unk>
In the last few years, it's a <unk>
In <unk> Music 2014, in 2014, <unk> in front of the word <unk> from three feet tall.
It was a <unk> show to see this pop star based openly feminism and making women and young men who will be feminist is something to be proud of.
<unk> the time, cultural critics started endless arguments if <unk> was or not precisely feminist.
They would take their feminism, instead of simply believing the word of an adult woman and <unk>
<unk> perfection from <unk> because we're still struggling with a lot, we want a lot, we need so much <unk>
We're going to go much beyond the sane and <unk> critical to <unk> the feminism of any woman, <unk> until it won't be there.
We don't need to do that.
The bad feminism, or rather, a more inclusive feminism is the point of <unk>
But what happens next?
We went from recognizing our <unk> to give the question to the action and be a little <unk>
If I hear music, I am creating a demand for artists that would be more happy to provide a <unk> supply.
These artists will not change their way to talk about women in their songs until it <unk> change affecting their profits.
It's certainly hard.
Why has his music to be so <unk>
It's hard to choose something better and so easy to justify a worse choice.
But when bad decisions justify this makes it more difficult for women to make equality, equality that we all deserve and is our responsibility.
I think of my <unk> three and four years.
It's two young girls and <unk> and <unk> and also very brave. I want to grow in a world.
They are telling them for the strong creatures that they are.
I think of them all of a sudden, and all of a sudden, the best choice is <unk> as something much easier to do.
We can all make better decisions.
We can change the channel when a television program is about sexual violence against women as a sport, <unk> the Game of <unk>
We can change radio electron when we hear songs that treat women like anything.
We can spend our money to go to cinema in another part when movies are not treating women more than as much as <unk> objects.
We can stop supporting professional sports where athletes treat their fellow <unk>
In any case, men, especially old white men can say, "No, I'm not going to post it in his project -- participating in your project, participate in your project, or working with you, until it doesn't include a number of enough women, both to participate as to make decisions.
I'm not going to work with you until your <unk> or your organization is more <unk> with a broader range of people."
Those of us who are <unk> but they are going to participate in these kinds of projects, and we can also encourage them to be even even more as much as we are <unk> to overcome the barriers to the decision seats.
Because we're not <unk> <unk> Without these efforts, without taking these <unk> our accomplishments are going to mean very little.
We can make these small acts of bravery and expect our decisions to come to the top of people in the power of the people in the power of the people in the power of CEOs and music, <unk> the people who can make great decisions, more courageous, to create a durable and meaningful change.
We can also say with courage to our feminism, well, bad, or any <unk>
The last line of my book <unk> <unk> says, <unk> to be a bad feminist to not be <unk>
This is true because of many reasons, but I say, especially because the old voice was reminded me and feminism helped me to <unk>
There was one incident.
I call it incident to address what happened.
A few guys told me when I was very young, and I didn't know that kids can do this to a girl.
They treated me as if it was anything.
I started to believe that it was nothing.
<unk> my voice, and after everything I did not tell myself to believe that I could say something that might matter.
But I was writing.
And I went back to <unk>
I became a stronger version of myself.
I read the words of those women who could understand a story like mine, and the women who looked like me and understood what meant to live in this world if you have the brown skin.
I read the words of the women who showed me that was nothing.
I learned how to write like them, and then I learned how to write like myself.
I found my voice again, and I started to believe that my voice is powerful beyond what you can measure.
Through writing and del writing, I also found that if I was a little brave, another woman could hear me and see me and realize that none of us is nothing that the world tries to tell us we are.
In one hand, I have the power to achieve anything.
And in the other, I hold the reality of my mind that I'm just a woman.
I'm a <unk> I am a good woman, I'm a good woman, I'm trying to improve my way to think, what I do, and what I do, without leaving everything that makes me human.
I hope we all can do the same thing.
I hope we could all be a little courageous, when you need such a <unk>
Just after Christmas last year, they were <unk> children in California had been able to have been exposed to somebody who had been there.
The virus then went through the border with Canada, <unk> to more than 100 children in <unk>
One of the <unk> things about this outbreak is that anyone who can be lousy for a child with an immune immune system is one of the most easily <unk> diseases in the world.
There is an effective vaccine against this for over half a century -- but a lot of the children involved in the <unk> outbreak hadn't been vaccinated because their parents were afraid of something that was supposed to still be <unk> autism.
But a moment, was not the article that sparked the controversial deal of autism and the <unk> <unk> and marked <unk> fraud by the British Medical <unk>
It doesn't believe the most intelligent scientists that vaccines cause autism is a <unk>
I think most of you know, but millions of parents around the world are still <unk> that vaccines will put in danger to their children of having autism.
Why?
Here's why.
This is a graph of the autism estimates of autism in time.
For most of the 20th century, autism was considered a very rare disease.
The few psychologists and <unk> that I had heard about her create their professional life without seeing one case.
For decades, the prevalence estimates continued to stable only three or four children per <unk>
But then, in the 1990s, the numbers started <unk>
<unk> of fundraising as <unk> <unk> refer to routinely autism as an epidemic as if I could <unk> another child in <unk>
What's going on?
If you're not vaccines, what is it?
If you ask people at the Center for Disease Control in Atlanta what's going on, they tend to be based on phrases like <unk> diagnostic and "an <unk> detection to explain these <unk> figures.
But that kind of language doesn't hate a lot of the fears of a young mother who looks for the face of his son of two years, the visual contact.
If the criteria of the diagnostic criteria had to be asked, why were they so reduced to the beginning?
Why were cases of autism so hard to find before the decade of <unk>
Five years ago, I decided to discover the answers to these questions.
I learned that what country has less to do with slow progress and <unk> of science than with the <unk> power of storytelling.
For most of the 20th century, the doctors told a story about what autism is and how it was discovered, but that story turned out to be false and the consequences of the same are having a devastating impact on global public health.
There was a second more accurate story of autism that had lost and forgotten in the dark corners of the clinical literature.
This second story tells us all about how we got here and where we have to go.
The first story starts with a child psychiatrist Leo Leo <unk> at Johns Hopkins <unk> in <unk> <unk> published an article that describes 11 young patients who seemed to be <unk> private worlds, <unk> people around us, even their own parents.
They could fun for hours to shaking their hands in front of their faces, but they were <unk> of panic for <unk> as when he didn't put his favorite toy in his usual place without knowing them.
On the basis of patients treated in their clinic, <unk> <unk> that autism is very rare.
By the age of 1950, as a major authority of the world in the subject, I declared that less than 150 real cases of their syndrome as we were growing up to places as distant as South Africa.
This is actually not wonder, because the criteria of <unk> for diagnosis autism were very <unk>
For example, <unk> giving that diagnosis to children with <unk> but now we know the epilepsy is very common in autism.
Once it was <unk> that he had turned nine percent of every 10 children to their office to be autistic without giving them a diagnosis of autism.
<unk> was a smart man, but part of his theories were not <unk>
<unk> autism as a form of child <unk> caused by cold, cold parents.
And these kids, he said, they've been carefully kept in a refrigerator that doesn't <unk>
At the same time, though, <unk> noticed that some of his young patients had special skills that cluster in certain areas like music, math and memory.
One of the kids in their clinic could distinguish between 18 symphonies, before I turned out the two years.
When his mother put one of his favorite records, he was properly <unk>
But <unk> had a bad opinion of these skills, affirming things like the kids were simply <unk> what they had heard of their parents -- they desperate to win their <unk>
As a result, autism became a source of shame for families, and two generations of autistic children were sent to institutions for their own well, turning it into invisible to the world in general.
Amazingly, it wasn't until the decade of 1970 that researchers started testing the theory of <unk> that autism was weird.
<unk> <unk> cognitive psychologist in London, I thought the theory of mothers -- <unk> was quite stupid.
She and her husband John was warm and <unk> and they had a deep autistic daughter called <unk>
<unk> and John knew how difficult it was to raise a girl as black-eyed <unk> no special education, no access to other resources without a diagnosis.
To defend on the National Service, the Health Service, they needed more resources for people who were autistic and their families, <unk> and his colleague Judith Gould decided to do something that should have done 30 years before.
They ran a prevalence study autism in the general population.
<unk> a suburb of London called <unk> to try to find the autistic children in the community.
What they saw was clear that the <unk> model was too limited, because the reality of autism was much more <unk> and diverse of life.
Some kids couldn't talk at all, whereas others were <unk> in their fascination by astrophysics, in dinosaurs or in the genealogy of <unk>
Otherwise, these kids didn't fit in beautiful frames and <unk> as <unk> said, and they saw a lot of them, much more than the <unk> model of <unk> would have predicted.
At first, they were lost by trying to make sense of their data.
How did no one ever remember these kids before?
But then I found a reference to an article published in German in German to <unk> the next year in <unk> and then <unk> buried under the ashes of a terrible time that nobody wanted to remember.
<unk> knew about this article of competition, but I avoided <unk> <unk> in his own work.
There was not even a translation of the English translation -- but luckily, the husband of <unk> speak German, and he did it for her.
The document offers an alternative story of autism.
His author was a man named Hans <unk> who ran an integrated clinic with a school in Vienna, in the 1930s.
<unk> ideas for teaching children with learning differences were <unk> even for contemporary standards.
The morning in his clinic started with music, and the kids kept their games on the afternoon.
Instead of blaming the parents to cause autism, Asperger's described the described as <unk> <unk> of life that required <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk>
Instead of treating kids in their clinic as patients, Asperger's called her little teachers, and he went to help in developing methods of education that were especially right for them.
Interestingly, Asperger's saw autism as a continual continuum that served a surprising variety of gifts, and disability.
He believed that autism and male traits were common, and they have always been, looking at aspects of this continuum in <unk> known in pop culture as the awkward social scientist and Professor <unk>
He was beyond even to say that for success in science and art, a hint of autism is essential.
<unk> and Judith found that <unk> was wrong when autism was <unk> as well as the parents were <unk>
Over the next few years, they worked in silence with the American Association of <unk> to expand the criteria of what they were called <unk> <unk>
By the end of the '80s and the early '90s, their changes were in <unk> by using the limited model of <unk> for a wide and <unk> model.
These changes didn't fall in broken <unk>
<unk> when we <unk> and Judith worked with the <unk> these <unk> people around the world see an autistic adult for the first time.
Before I went out of <unk> <unk> in 1988, only a small circle, <unk> by experts knew what autism was but after the <unk> performance of <unk> <unk> as <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> with four awards from <unk> <unk> psychologists, teachers and parents all over the world knew what autism was.
At the same time, they introduced the first clinical trials to use to diagnose autism.
He had no connection to that little circle of experts to get a diagnosis for her son.
The combination of <unk> <unk> the changes in the criteria and the introduction of these tests created a network, a perfect storm of the consciousness of autism.
The number of diagnoses started <unk> the same as they predicted <unk> and <unk> in fact they hoped that it was so out of it, making people with autism and their families finally <unk> the support and services that were <unk>
Then Andrew <unk> came to blame vaccines for the rise in the <unk> and a simple, powerful story as bad as the <unk> theory that autism was <unk>
If the current estimate of the prevention center that one in the United States is in the spectrum, it's right in the spectrum, it's right, the autistic ones are one of the largest <unk> groups in the world.
In the last few years, people are wired on the Internet to reject the idea that these are puzzles by solving the new breakthroughs -- doctors, <unk> the term <unk> to celebrate varieties of human cognition.
A way to understand <unk> is to think in terms of human operating systems.
The fact that a PC doesn't work with Windows doesn't mean it's broken.
According to the <unk> the normal human brain is easily <unk> social, and suffers from a attention deficit to detail.
No doubt, people are trying to live in a world not built for them.
70 years later, we're still getting <unk> that I believed that <unk> for the most <unk> aspects of autism are found in the understanding of teachers, employers with ability, and parents with faith in the potential of their children.
An autistic woman named <unk> <unk> once said, "We need all the hands in cover to <unk> the ship of the <unk>
As we go into an uncertain future, we need all forms of human intelligence on the planet to address the challenges we face as a society.
We can't afford to waste or a brain.
Thank you.
